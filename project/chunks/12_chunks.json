In module disable mode, the clock used by the non-register portion of the EBI is disabled to reduce power consumption. The clock signal dedicated to the registers, however, allows access to the registers even while the EBI is in the module disable mode. Flag bits in the EBI transfer error status register (EBI\\_TESR), however, are set and cleared with the clock used by the non-register portion of the EBI. Consequently, in module disable mode, the EBI\\_TESR does not have a clock signal and is therefore not writable."

Enables the external master mode of operation when MDIS = 0. WhenMDIS = 1, the EXTMbit is a don't care, and is treated as 0. In external master mode, an external master on the external bus can access any internal memory-mapped space while the internal e200z6 core is fully operational. When EXTM = 0, only internal masters can access the internal memory space. This bit also determines the functionality of the BR, BG, and BB signals. Note: The SIU PCRregisters must configure BR, BG, and BBfor EBI function (as opposed to default GPIO) prior to EXTM being set to 1, or erroneous behavior may result. 0 External master mode is inactive (single master mode) 1 External master mode is active Note: In the MPC5553, only master/slave systems support the EXTM functionality.

Writing a 0 has no effect.\n\nThis register is not writable in module disable mode due to the use of power saving clock modes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|          | 0             | 1             | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             | 6             | 7             | 8             | 9             | 10            | 11            | 12            | 13            | 14            | 15            |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| R        | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| W        |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Reset    | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 |\n|          | 16            | 17            | 18            | 19            | 20            | 21            | 22            | 23            | 24            | 25            | 26            | 27            | 28            | 29            | 30            | 31            |\n| R        | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | TEAF          | BMTF          |\n| W        |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               | w1c           | w1c           |\n| Reset    | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 |\n\nNote: w1c means 'write 1 to clear' and is explained in the Preface.\n\nFigure 12-3.

Each time an internal to external bus cycle access is requested, the internal address is compared with the base address of each valid base register (with 17 bits having mask). See Figure 12-7. If a match is found, the attributes defined for this bank in its BR and OR are used to control the memory access. If a match is found in more than one bank, the lowest bank matched handles the memory access. For example, bank 0 is selected over bank 1.\n\nFigure 12-7. Bank Base Address and Match Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMPC5553/MPC5554 Microcontroller Reference Manual, Rev. 3.1\n\nA match on a valid calibration chip select register overrides a match on any non-calibration chip select register,  with  CAL\\_CS0  having  the  highest  priority.  Thus  the  full  priority  of  the  chip  selects  is: CAL\\_CS0....CAL\\_CS3, CS0....CS3.\n\nWhen a match is found on one of the chip select banks, all its attributes (from the appropriate base and option registers) are selected for the functional operation of the external memory access, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Number of wait states for a single memory access, and for any beat in a burst access\n- \u00b7 Burst enable\n- \u00b7 Port size for the external accessed device\n\nSee  Section 12.3.1.6,  'EBI  Base  Registers  0-3  (EBI\\_BRn)  and  EBI  Calibration  Base  Registers  0-3 (EBI\\_CAL\\_BRn),' and Section 12.3.1.7, 'EBI Option Registers 0-3 (EBI\\_ORn) and EBI Calibration Option Registers 0-3 (EBI\\_CAL\\_ORn),' for a full description of all chip select attributes.\n\nWhen  no  match  is  found  on  any  of  the  chip  select  banks,  the  default  transfer  attributes  shown  in Table 12-13 are used.\n\nTable 12-13.

Burst length is configured for each chip select by using the BL bit in the appropriate base register. See Section 12.4.2.5, 'Burst Transfer' for more details.\n\nIn 16-bit data bus mode (EBI\\_MCR[DBM]=1), a special 2-beat burst case is supported for reads and writes for 32-bit non-chip select accesses only. This is to allow 32-bit coherent accesses to another MCU. See Section 12.4.2.11, 'Non-Chip-Select Burst in 16-bit Data Bus Mode'.\n\nBursting of accesses that are not controlled by the chip selects is not supported for any other case besides the special case of 32-bit accesses in 16-bit data bus mode.\n\nBurst writes are not supported for any other case besides the special case of 32-bit non-chip select writes in 16-bit data bus mode. Internal requests to write more than 32 bits (such as a cache line) externally are broken  up  into  separate  32-bit  or 16-bit external transactions according  to  the  port size.

Arbitration is discussed in detail in Section 12.4.2.8, 'Arbitration.'\n\nThe address transfer phase specifies the address for the transaction and the transfer attributes that describe the  transaction.  The  signals  related  to  the  address  transfer  phase  are  TS,  ADDR,  CS[0:3],  RD\\_WR, TSIZ[0:1], and BDIP. The address and its related signals (with the exception of TS, BDIP) are driven on the bus with the assertion of the TS signal, and kept valid until the bus master receives TA asserted (the EBI holds them one cycle beyond TA for writes and external TA accesses). Note that for writes with internal TA, RD\\_WR is not held one cycle past TA.\n\nMPC5553/MPC5554 Microcontroller Reference Manual, Rev. 3.1\n\nThe data transfer phase performs the transfer of data, from master to slave (in write cycles) or from slave to master (on read cycles), if any is to be transferred. The data phase may transfer a single beat of data (1-4 bytes) for non-burst operations or a 2-beat (special EBI\\_MCR[DBM]=1 case only), 4-beat, 8-beat, or 16-beat burst of data (2 or 4 bytes per beat depending on port size) when burst is enabled. On a write cycle, the master must not drive write data until after the address transfer phase is complete. This is to avoid electrical contentions when switching between drivers. The master must start driving write data one cycle after the address transfer cycle. The master can stop driving the data bus as soon as it samples the TA line asserted on the rising edge of CLKOUT. To facilitate asynchronous write support, the EBI keeps driving valid write data on the data bus until 1 clock after the rising edge where RD\\_WR and WE are negated (for chip select accesses only). See Figure 12-14 for an example of write timing. On a read cycle, the master accepts the data bus contents as valid on the rising edge of the CLKOUT in which the TA signal is sampled asserted. See Figure 12-10 for an example of read timing.\n\nThe termination phase is where the cycle is terminated by the assertion of either TA (normal termination) or  TEA  (termination  with  error).  Termination  is  discussed  in  detail  in  Section 12.4.2.9,  'Termination Signals Protocol.'"

If an internal request to the EBI indicates a size of less than 32 bytes, the request is fulfilled by running one or more single-beat external transfers, not by an external burst transfer.\n\nAn 8-word wrapping burst reads eight 32-bit words by supplying a starting address that points to one of the words (doubleword aligned) and requiring the memory device to sequentially drive each word on the data bus. The selected slave device must internally increment ADDR[27:29] (also ADDR30 in the case of a 16-bit port size device) of the supplied address for each transfer, until the address reaches an 8-word boundary, and then wrap the address to the beginning of the 8-word boundary. The address and transfer attributes supplied by the EBI remain stable during the transfers, and the EBI terminates each beat transfer by asserting TA. The EBI requires that addresses be aligned to a doubleword boundary on all burst cycles.\n\nTable 12-16 shows the burst order of beats returned for an 8-word burst to a 32-bit port.\n\nTable 12-16. Wrap Bursts Order\n\n|   Burst Starting Address ADDR[27:28] | Burst Order (Assuming 32-bit Port Size)                              |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                   00 | word0 -> word1 -> word2 -> word3 -> word4 -> word5 -> word6 -> word7 |\n|                                   01 | word2 -> word3 -> word4 -> word5 -> word6 -> word7 -> word0 -> word1 |\n|                                   10 | word4 -> word5 -> word6 -> word7 -> word0 -> word1 -> word2 -> word3 |\n|                                   11 | word6 -> word7 -> word0 -> word1 -> word2 -> word3 -> word4 -> word5 |\n\nThe general case of burst transfers assumes that the external memory has 32-bit port size and 8-word burst length. The EBI can also burst from 16-bit port size memories, taking twice as many external beats to fetch the data as compared to a 32-bit port with the same burst length. The EBI can also burst from 16-bit or 32-bit memories that have a 4-word burst length (BL = 1 in the appropriate base register). In this case, two external 4-word burst transfers (wrapping on 4-word boundary) are performed to fulfill the internal 8-word request. This operation is considered atomic by the EBI, so the EBI does not allow other unrelated master accesses or bus arbitration to intervene between the transfers. For more details and a timing diagram, see Section 12.4.2.6.3, 'Small Access Example #3: 32-byte Read to 32-bit Port with BL = 1.'\n\nDuring burst cycles, the BDIP (burst data in progress) signal is used to indicate the duration of the burst data. During the data phase of a burst read cycle, the EBI receives data from the addressed slave. If the EBI needs more than one data, it asserts the BDIP signal. Upon receiving the data prior to the last data, the EBI negates BDIP. Thus, the slave stops driving new data after it receives the negation of BDIP on the rising edge of the clock. Some slave devices have their burst length and timing configurable internally and thus may not support connecting to a BDIP pin. In this case, BDIP is driven by the EBI normally, but the output is ignored by the memory and the burst data behavior is determined by the internal configuration of the EBI and slave device. When the TBDIP bit is set in the appropriate base register, the timing for BDIP is altered. See Section 12.4.2.5.1, 'TBDIP Effect on Burst Transfer,' for this timing.\n\nSince burst writes are not supported by the EBI , the EBI negates BDIP during write cycles. 1\n\n1.

In 16-bit data bus mode (DBM=1), one 2-beat burst access is performed and this is not considered a small access case. See Section 12.4.2.11, 'Non-Chip-Select Burst in 16-bit Data Bus Mode' for this special DBM=1 case.\n\nIn most cases, the timing for small accesses is the same as for normal single-beat and burst accesses, except that multiple back-to-back external transfers are executed for each internal request. These transfers have no additional dead cycles in-between that are not present for back-to-back stand-alone transfers except for the case of writes with an internal request size greater than 64 bits, discussed in Section 12.4.2.6.2, 'Small Access Example #2: 32-byte Write with External TA.'\n\nThe following sections show a few examples of small accesses. The timing for the remaining cases in Table 12-17 can be extrapolated from these and the other timing diagrams in this document."

    "content": "The external bus design provides for a single bus master at any one time, either the MCU or an external device. One of the external devices on the bus has the capability of becoming bus master for the external bus. Bus arbitration may be handled either by an external central bus arbiter or by the internal on-chip arbiter. The arbitration configuration (external or internal) is set via the EARB bit in the EBI\\_MCR.\n\nEach bus master must have bus request, bus grant, and bus busy signals. The signals are described in detail in Section 12.2.1, 'Detailed Signal Descriptions.' The device that needs the bus asserts the bus request (BR) signal. The device then waits for the arbiter to assert the bus grant (BG) signal. In addition, the new master must sample the bus busy (BB) signal to ensure that no other master is driving the bus before it can\n\nassert bus busy to assume ownership of the bus. The new master must sample bus busy negated for two cycles before asserting bus busy, to avoid any potential conflicts. Any time the arbiter has taken the bus grant away from the master, and the master wants to execute a new cycle, the master must re-arbitrate before  a  new  cycle  can  begin.  The  EBI,  however,  whether  the  internal  or  external  arbiter  is  used, guarantees data coherency for access to a small port size and for decomposed bursts. This means that the EBI does not release the bus before the completion of the transactions which are considered as atomic.\n\nFigure 12-31 describes the basic protocol for bus arbitration.\n\nFigure 12-31.

    "content": "The external arbiter can be either another MCU in a two master system, or a separate central arbiter device. When an MCU is configured to use external arbitration, that MCU asserts BR when it needs ownership of the external bus, and it waits for BG to be asserted from the external arbiter. For timing reasons, a latched (1 cycle delayed) version of BG is used by the EBI in external arbitration mode. This is not a requirement of the protocol. After BG assertion is received and BB is sampled negated for two cycles, the MCU asserts BB and initiates the  transaction.  An  MCU  operating  under  external arbitration  may  run  back-to-back accesses  without  rearbitrating  as  long  as  it  is  still  receiving  BG  asserted.  If  BG  is  negated  during  a transaction, the MCU must rearbitrate for the bus before the next transaction. The determination of priority between masters is determined entirely by the external arbiter in this mode.\n\nFigure 12-32 shows example timing for the case of two masters connected to a central arbiter. In this case, the BR0 and BR1 signals shown are inputs to the arbiter from the BR pin of each master. The BG0 and BG1 signals are outputs from the arbiter that connect to the BG pin of each master.\n\nFigure 12-32. Central Arbitration Timing Diagram\n\n<!-- image -->"

    "content": "When an MCU is configured to use the internal bus arbiter, that MCU is parked on the bus. The parking feature allows the MCU to skip the bus request phase, and if BB is negated, assert BB, and initiate the transaction  without  waiting  for  bus  grant  from  the  arbiter.  The  priority  between  internal  and  external masters over the external bus is determined by the EARP field of the EBI\\_MCR. See Table 12-8 for the EARP field description.\n\nBy default, internal and external masters are treated with equal priority, with each having to relinquish the bus after the current transaction if another master is requesting it. If internal and external requests for the bus occur in the same cycle, the internal arbiter grants the bus to the master who least recently used the bus. If no other master is requesting the bus, the bus continues to be granted to the current master, and the current master may start another access without re-arbitrating for the bus.\n\nIf the priority field is configured for unequal priority between internal and external masters, then whenever requests are pending from both masters, the one with higher priority is always granted the bus. However, in all cases, a transaction in progress (or that has already been granted, for example MCU bus wait and external bus wait states) is allowed to complete, even when a request from a higher priority master is pending.\n\nThere is a minimum of one cycle between the positive edge CLKOUT that a BR assertion is sampled by the EBI and the positive edge CLKOUT where BG is driven out asserted by the EBI. This is to avoid timing problems that would otherwise limit the frequency of operation in external master mode.\n\nThe external master is given 2 cycles to start its access after a posed CLKOUT in which bus grant was given to it by the internal arbiter (BG asserted, BB negated for 2 cycles). This means when BG is negated (to take away bus grant from the external master), the EBI does not start an access of its own for 3 cycles (1 extra cycle in order to detect external BB assertion). If the external master jumps on the bus (by asserting\n\nBB) during the 2-cycle window, the EBI detects the BB assertion and delays starting its access until the external master access has completed (BB negated for 2 cycles). Figure 12-33 shows this 2-cycle window of opportunity.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Earliest cycle M0 can assert BB if M1 has not asseretd BB yet. *\n\nFigure 12-33. Internal Arbitration, 2-Cycle Window-of-Opportunity\n\nFigure 12-34 shows example timing for the case of one master using internal arbitration (master 0), while another master is configured for external arbitration (master 1). In this case, the BR signals of each master are connected together, since only master 1 drives BR. The BG signals of each master are also connected together, since only master 0 drives BG. See Figure 12-37 for an example of these connections.\n\nFigure 12-34.

The state machine uses the previous clock value to avoid potential speed paths with trying to calculate bus grant based on a late-arriving external BR signal.\n- 3 The Input column for BB shows the value driven on BB the previous cycle from an external source. The state machine uses the previous clock value to ensure adequate switching time between masters driving the same signal and to avoid potential speed paths.\n- 4 This represents an internal EBI signal that indicates whether an internal request for use of the external bus is pending. Once a transaction for a pending request has been started on the external bus, this internal signal is cleared. The state machine uses the previous clock value to avoid potential speed paths with trying to calculate bus grant based on a late-arriving internal request signal.\n- 5 This represents an internal EBI signal that indicates whether the internal MCU (0) or external master (1) currently has higher priority.\n- 6 This represents an internal EBI signal that indicates whether an EBI-mastered transaction on the bus is in progress this cycle or is going to start the next cycle (and thus has already been committed internally).\n- 7 This represents an internal EBI signal that indicates whether the bus was granted to an external master (BG = 0, previous BB = 1) during the previous 3 cycles.\n- 8 RGB is always low in this state, thus it is ignored in the transition logic.\n- 9 RGB is always low in this state, thus it is ignored in the transition logic.\n- 10 The ETP signal is never asserted in states where it is shown as an 'X' for all transitions.\n- 11 RGB is always high in this state, thus it is ignored in the transition logic.\n\n- 12 IRP is ignored (treated as 1) in the MCU\\_WAIT state because the EBI does not optimally support an internal master cancelling its bus request. If IRP is negated in this state, the EBI still grants the internal master the bus as if IRP was still asserted, and a few cycles may be wasted before the external master may be able to grab the bus again (depending on BR, BB, etc., according to normal transition logic).\n- 13 The default BB output is 0 for this state. However, anytime the EBI transitions from a state where BB = 0 to a state where BB = hiZ, there is one external cycle (in this state) where the EBI drives BB = 1 to actively negate the pin before letting go to hiZ. In the case where a second granted internal request (IRP = 1, ETP=1) is ready to start just before the transition to the hiZ state would otherwise have occurred (during the BB = 1active negate cycle), then BB is driven back to 0 to start the next access without ever leaving this state or going to hiZ.\n- 14 BR is ignored (treated as 0) in the EXT\\_WAIT state because the EBI does not optimally support an external master cancelling its bus request. If BR is negated in this state, the EBI still grants the external master the bus as if BR was still asserted, and a few cycles may be wasted while the external master 'window-of-opportunity' is satisfied before the internal master may be able to grab the bus again (depending on BR, BB, etc., according to normal transition logic).\n\nFigure 12-35 shows the internal finite state machine that implements the arbiter protocol.\n\nFigure 12-35.

    "chunk_type": "text",
    "content": "The termination signals protocol was defined in order to avoid electrical contention on lines that can be driven by various sources. In order to do that, a slave must not drive signals associated with the data transfer until the address phase is completed and it recognizes the address as its own. The slave must disconnect from signals immediately after it acknowledges the cycle and not later than the termination of the next address phase cycle.\n\nFor EBI-mastered non-chip select accesses, the EBI requires assertion of TA from an external device to signal that the bus cycle is complete. The EBI uses a latched version of TA (1 cycle delayed) for these accesses to help make timing at high frequencies. This results in the EBI driving the address and control signals 1 cycle longer than required, as seen in Figure 12-36. However, the DATA does not need to be held 1 cycle longer by the slave, because the EBI latches DATA every cycle during non-chip select accesses. During these accesses, the EBI does not drive the TA signal, leaving it up to an external device (or weak internal pull-up) to drive TA.\n\nFor EBI-mastered chip select accesses, the EBI drives TA the entire cycle, asserting according to internal wait state counters to terminate the cycle. During idle periods on the external bus, the EBI drives TA negated as long as it is granted the bus; when it no longer owns the bus it lets go of TA. When an external master does a transaction to internal address space, the EBI only drives TA for the cycle it asserts TA to return data and for 1 cycle afterwards to ensure fast negation.\n\nIf no device responds by asserting TA within the programmed timeout period (BMT in EBI\\_BMCR) after the EBI initiates the bus cycle, the internal bus monitor (if enabled) asserts TEA to terminate the cycle. An external device may also drive TEA when it detects an error on an external transaction. TEA assertion causes the cycle to terminate and the processor to enter exception processing for the error condition. To properly control termination of a bus cycle for a bus error with external circuitry, TEA must be asserted at the same time or before (external) TA is asserted. TEA must be negated before the second rising edge after it was sampled asserted in order to avoid the detection of an error for the following bus cycle initiated. TEA is only driven by the EBI during the cycle where the EBI is asserting TEA and the cycle immediately following this assertion (for fast negation). During all other cycles, the EBI relies on a weak internal pull-up to hold TEA negated. This allows an external device to assert TEA when it needs to indicate an error. External devices must follow the same protocol as the EBI, only driving TEA during the assertion cycle and 1 cycle afterwards for negation."

    "content": "In the case where an external master asserts TEA to timeout a transaction to an  internal  address  on  this  MCU,  the  EBI  has  no  way  to  terminate  the transfer internally. Therefore, any subsequent TS assertions by the external master  are  ignored  by  the  EBI  until  the  original  transfer  has  completed internally and the EBI has returned to an idle state. The expectation is that the internal slaves will always respond with either valid data or an error indication within a reasonable period of time to avoid hanging the system.\n\nWhen TEA is asserted from an external source, the EBI uses a latched version of TEA (1 cycle delayed) to help make timing at high frequencies. This means that for any accesses where the EBI drives TA (chip select accesses and external master accesses to EBI), a TEA assertion that occurs 1 cycle before or during the last TA of the access could be ignored by the EBI, since it will have completed the access internally before it detects the latched TEA assertion. This means that non-burst chip select accesses with no wait states (SCY = 0) cannot be reliably terminated by external TEA. If external error termination is required for such a device, the EBI must be configured for SCY \u2265 1."

For some small access cases (which always use chip select and internally-driven TA), a TEA that occurs 1 cycle before or during the TA cycle or for SCY = 0 may in fact lead to terminating the cycle with error. However, proper error termination is not guaranteed for these cases, so TEA must always be asserted at least 2 cycles before an internally-driven TA cycle for proper error termination.\n\nExternal TEA assertion that occurs during the same cycle that TS is asserted by the EBI is always treated as an error (terminating the access) regardless of SCY.\n\nTable 12-24 summarizes how the EBI recognizes the termination signals provided from an external device.\n\nTable 12-24. Termination Signals Protocol\n\n| TEA 1    | TA 1     | Action                      |\n|----------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| Negated  | Negated  | No Termination              |\n| Asserted | X        | Transfer Error Termination  |\n| Negated  | Asserted | Normal Transfer Termination |\n\n- 1 Latched version (1 cycle delayed) used for externally driven TEA and TA.\n\nFigure 12-36 shows an example of the termination signals protocol for back-to-back reads to two different slave devices who properly take turns driving the termination signals. This assumes a system using slave devices that drive termination signals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 12-36. Termination Signals Protocol Timing Diagram"

    "content": "Without arbitration pins, a dual-master system is impossible, because these is no way for the two masters to take turns driving the external bus without conflicts. However, a master/slave system is possible, as described below.\n\nTo implement a master/slave system with an MCU that has no arbitration pins (BB, BG, BR), the user must configure  the  master  MCU  for  internal  arbitration  (EARB=0  in  EBI\\_MCR)  and  the  slave  MCU  for external arbitration (EARB=1). Internally on an MCU with no arbitration pins, the BR, BG, and BB signals to the EBI will be tied negated. This means that the slave MCU will never receive bus grant asserted, so it will never attempt to start an access on the external bus. The master MCU will never receive bus request or  bus  busy  asserted,  so  it  will  maintain  ownership  of  the  bus  without  any  arbitration  delays.  In  the erroneous case that the slave MCU executes internal code that attempts to access external address space, that access will never get external and will eventually time-out in the slave MCU."

Therefore, the EBI bus monitor should be disabled when no TEA pin exists."
