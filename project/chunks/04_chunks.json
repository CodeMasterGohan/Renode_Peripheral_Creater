    "content": "The following reset sources are supported in the MPC5553/MPC5554 MCU:\n\n- \u00b7 Power-on reset\n- \u00b7 External reset\n- \u00b7 Loss-of-lock reset\n- \u00b7 Loss-of-clock reset\n- \u00b7 Watchdog timer/debug reset\n- \u00b7 JTAG reset\n- \u00b7 Checkstop reset\n- \u00b7 Software system reset\n- \u00b7 Software external reset\n\nAll reset sources are processed by the reset controller, which is located in the SIU module. The reset controller monitors the reset input sources, and upon detection of a reset event, resets internal logic and controls the assertion of the RSTOUT pin. The RSTOUT signal may be automatically asserted by writing the SER bit in the SIU\\_SRCR to 1. The RSTOUT signal will stay asserted for a number of system clocks 1 determined by the configuration of the PLL (See Section 4.2.2, 'Reset Output (RSTOUT)'). This does not reset the MPC5553/MPC5554 MCU. All other reset sources initiate an internal reset of the MCU.\n\nFor all reset sources, the BOOTCFG[0:1] and PLLCFG[0:1] signals can be used to determine the boot mode and the configuration of the FMPLL, respectively. If the RSTCFG pin is asserted during reset, the values on the BOOTCFG[0:1] pins are latched in the SIU\\_RSR 4 clock cycles prior to the negation of the RSTOUT pin, determining the boot mode. The values on the PLLCFG[0:1] pins are latched at the negation of the RSTOUT pin, determining the configuration of the FMPLL. If the RSTCFG pin is negated during reset, the FMPLL defaults to normal operation (PLL enabled) with a crystal reference and the boot mode (latched in the SIU\\_RSR) is defaulted to internal boot from Flash.\n\nThe reset status register (SIU\\_RSR) gives the source of the last reset and indicates whether a glitch has occurred on the RESET pin. The SIU\\_RSR is updated for all reset sources.\n\nAll reset sources initiate execution of the MPC5553/MPC5554 boot assist module (BAM) program with the exception of the software external reset.\n\nThe reset configuration half word (RCHW) provides several basic functions at reset. It provides a means to locate the boot code, determines if Flash memory is programmed or erased, enables or disables the watchdog timer, and if booting externally, sets the bus size. The location of the RCHW is specified by the state of the BOOTCFG[0:1] pins. These pins determine whether the RCHW is located in internal Flash, located in external memory, or whether a serial or CAN boot is configured. A complete description of the BOOTCFG[0:1] pins may be found in Chapter 2, 'Signal Description.' The BAM program reads the values of the BOOTCFG[0:1] pins from the BOOTCFG field of the SIU\\_RSR, then reads the RCHW from the specified location and uses the RCHW value to determine and execute the specified boot procedure. See Section 4.4.3, 'Reset Configuration and Configuration Pins,' for a complete description.\n\n1.  Unless noted otherwise, the use of 'clock' or 'clocks' in this section is a reference to the system clock."

A  bit  set  to  logic  1  indicates  the  type  of  reset  that  occurred. Simultaneous reset requests cause more than one bit to be set at the same time. Once set, the reset source bits in the SIU\\_RSR remain set until another reset occurs. A software external reset causes the SERF bit to be set, but no previously set bits in the SIU\\_RSR will be cleared. Additional information about the SIU\\_RSR may be found in Section 6.3.1.2, 'Reset Status Register (SIU\\_RSR).'\n\nThe SIU\\_RSR also contains the values latched at the last reset on the WKPCFG and BOOTCFG[0:1] pins and a RESET input pin glitch flag. The reset glitch flag bit (RGF) is cleared by writing a 1 to the bit. A write of 0 has no effect on the bit state.

    "content": "The system reset control register (SIU\\_SRCR) allows software to generate either a software system reset or software external reset. The software system reset causes an internal reset sequence, while the software external  reset  only  causes  the  external  RSTOUT  pin  to  be  asserted.  When  written  to  1,  the  SER  bit automatically  clears  after  a  predetermined  number  of  clock  cycles  (See  Section 4.2.2,  'Reset  Output (RSTOUT)'). If the value of the SER bit is 1 and a 0 is written to the bit, the bit is cleared and the RSTOUT pin is negated regardless of whether the relevant number of clocks has expired.\n\nThe CRE bit in the SIU\\_SRCR allows software to enable a checkstop reset. If enabled, a checkstop reset will occur if the checkstop reset input to the reset controller is asserted. The checkstop reset is enabled by default.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|          | 0           | 1           | 2           | 3           | 4           | 5           | 6           | 7           | 8           | 9           | 10          | 11          | 12          | 13          | 14          | 15          |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| R        | SSR         | SER         | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           |\n| W        |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |\n| Reset 1  | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 |\n|          | 16          | 17          | 18          | 19          | 20          | 21          | 22          | 23          | 24          | 25          | 26          | 27          | 28          | 29          | 30          | 31          |\n| R        | CRE         | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           |\n| W        |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |             |\n| Reset    | 1 1         | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 | Base + 0x10 |\n\n1 The CRE bit is reset to 1 by POR.

    "content": "The power-on reset (POR) circuit is designed to detect a POR event and ensure that the RESET signal is correctly sensed. The POR is not intended to be used to detect falling power supply voltages. External supply monitoring should be provided. The output signals from the power-on reset circuits are active low signals. All power-on reset output signals are combined into one POR signal at the V DD  level and input to the reset controller. Although assertion of the power-on reset signal causes reset, the RESET pin must be asserted during a power-on reset to guarantee proper operation of the MCU.\n\nThe PLLCFG[0:1] and RSTCFG pins determine the configuration of the FMPLL. If the RSTCFG pin is asserted at the negation of RSTOUT, the PLLCFG[0:1] pins set the operating mode of the FMPLL. If RSTCFG is asserted  anytime  during  the  assertion  of  RSTOUT,  the  FMPLL  will  switch  to  the  mode specified by the PLLCFG[0:1] pins. The values on the RSTCFG and the PLLCFG[0:1] pins must be kept constant once RSTCFG is asserted to avoid transient mode changes in the FMPLL. If RSTCFG is in the negated state at the negation of RSTOUT, the FMPLL defaults to enabled with a crystal reference. See Chapter 11, 'Frequency Modulated Phase Locked Loop (FMPLL) and System Clocks,' for more details on the operation of the FMPLL and the PLLCFG[0:1] pins.\n\nThe signal on the WKPCFG pin determines whether weak pull up or pull down devices are enabled after reset on the eTPU and eMIOS pins. The WKPCFG pin is applied starting at the assertion of the internal reset signal, as indicated by the assertion of RSTOUT. Refer to Figure 4-4 and see Chapter 2, 'Signal Description,' for information on WKPCFG and RSTOUT.\n\nOnce the RESET input pin is negated, the reset controller checks if the FMPLL is locked. The internal reset signal and RSTOUT are kept asserted until the FMPLL is locked. After the FMPLL is locked, the reset  controller  waits  an  additional  predetermined  number  of  clock  cycles  (See  Section 4.2.2,  'Reset Output (RSTOUT)') before negating the RSTOUT pin. The WKPCFG and BOOTCFG[0:1] pins are sampled 4 clock cycles before the negation of RSTOUT, and the associated bits/fields are updated in the SIU\\_RSR (note that the BOOTCFG[0:1] pins are only sampled if RSTCFG is asserted). In addition, the PORS and ERS bits are set, and all other reset status bits are cleared in the reset status register."

For all reset sources except the software external reset, the WKPCFG pin is applied starting at the assertion of the internal reset signal (as indicated by the assertion of RSTOUT). If the WKPCFG signal is logic high at this time, pull up devices will be enabled on the eTPU and eMIOS pins. If the WKPCFG signal is logic low at the assertion of the internal reset signal, pull down devices will be enabled on those pins. The value on WKPCFG must be held constant during reset to avoid oscillations on the eTPU and eMIOS pins caused by switching pull up/down states. The final value of WKPCFG is latched 4 clock cycles before the negation of RSTOUT. After reset, software may modify the weak pull up/down selection for all I/O pins through the PCRs in the SIU.\n\nTable 4-6.

This field serves two functions. First, it is used to indicate which block in Flash memory contains the boot program. Second, it identifies whether the Flash memory is programmed or invalid. The value of a valid boot identifier is 0x5A (0b01011010). The BAMprogram checks the first half word of each Flash memory block starting at block 0 until a valid boot identifier is found. If all blocks in the low address space of the internal Flash are checked and no valid boot identifier is found, then the internal Flash is assumed to be invalid and a CAN/SCI boot is initiated. For an external boot, only block 0 is checked for a valid boot identifier, and if not found, a CAN/SCI boot is initiated. |"

Refer to Chapter 16, 'Boot Assist Module (BAM)' for more information.\n\nIf a valid RCHW is not found, a serial boot is initiated. A serial boot does not use a RCHW. The watchdog timer is enabled.

    "content": "The  reset  configuration  half  word  (RCHW)  specifies  a  minimal  MCU  configuration  after  reset.  The RCHW also contains bits that control the BAM program flow. See Section 16.3.2.1.1, 'Finding Reset Configuration Half Word' for information on the BAM using the RCHW. The RCHW is read and applied each time the BAM program executes, which is for every power-on, external, or internal reset event. The only exception to this is the software external reset. See Section 4.4.3.5, 'Reset Configuration Half Word,' for detailed descriptions of the bits in the RCHW. The RCHW is read from one of the following locations:\n\n- \u00b7 The lowest address (0x00\\_0000) of an external memory device, enabled by chip select CS0 using either a 16- or 32-bit data bus\n- \u00b7 The lowest address of one of the six low address space (LAS) blocks in the internal Flash memory. (2 x 16K; 2 x 48K; 2 x 64K)\n\nAt the negation of the RSTOUT pin, the BOOTCFG field in the RSR has been updated. If BOOTCFG0 is asserted, then the BAM program reads the RCHW from address 0x0000\\_0000 in the external memory connected  to  CS0  (the  BAM  first  configures  the  MMU  and  CS0  such  that  address  0x0000\\_0000  is translated  to  0x2000\\_0000  and  then  directed  to  CS0).  When  BOOTCFG0  is  asserted,  BOOTCFG1 determines whether external arbitration must be enabled to fetch the RCHW.\n\nIf BOOTCFG0 and BOOTCFG1 are negated at the negation of the RSTOUT pin, then the BAM program attempts to read the RCHW from the first address of each of the 6 blocks in the low address space (LAS) of internal Flash. Table 4-9 shows the LAS addresses.\n\nTable 4-9. LAS Block Memory Addresses\n\n|   Block | Address     |\n|---------|-------------|\n|       0 | 0x0000_0000 |\n|       1 | 0x0000_4000 |\n|       2 | 0x0001_0000 |\n|       3 | 0x0001_C000 |\n|       4 | 0x0002_0000 |\n|       5 | 0x0003_0000 |\n\nIf the RCHW stored in either internal or external Flash is invalid (boot identifier field of RCHW is not 0x5A), or if BOOTCFG0 is negated and BOOTCFG1 is asserted at the negation of the RSTOUT pin, then RCHW is not applicable, and serial boot mode is performed. Table 4-10 summarizes the RCHW location options."
