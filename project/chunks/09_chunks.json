It is intended for use in applications where the data size to be transferred is statically known, and is not defined within the data packet itself. The eDMA module features:\n\n- \u00b7 All data movement via dual-address transfers: read from source, write to destination\n- - Programmable source, destination addresses, transfer size, plus support for enhanced addressing modes\n\n- \u00b7 64-channel (MPC5554) or 32-channel (MPC5553) implementation performs complex data transfers with minimal intervention from a host processor\n- - 32 bytes of data registers, used as temporary storage to support burst transfers (refer to SSIZE bit)\n- - Connections to the crossbar switch for bus mastering the data movement\n- \u00b7 Transfer control descriptor (TCD) organized to support two-deep, nested transfer operations - 32-byte TCD per channel stored in local memory\n- - An inner data transfer loop defined by a minor byte transfer count\n- - An outer data transfer loop defined by a major iteration count\n- \u00b7 Channel activation via one of three methods:\n- - Explicit software initiation\n- - Initiation via a channel-to-channel linking mechanism for continual transfers\n- - Peripheral-paced hardware requests (one per channel)"

Reading or writing to a reserved memory location will generate a bus error.\n\nMany of the control registers have a bit width that matches the number of channels implemented in the module, or 64-bits in size. These registers are implemented as two 32-bit registers, and include an 'H' and 'L' suffixes, signaling the 'high' and 'low' portions of the control function. Note that for the MPC5553, only the Low register is implemented for its 32 channels. High (H) registers are reserved on the MPC5553 and accessing them will generate a bus error."

    "content": "The 32-bit EDMA\\_CR defines the basic operating configuration of the eDMA.\n\nFor the MPC5554  the eDMA arbitrates channel service requests in four groups (0, 1, 2, 3) of 16 channels each; the MPC5553 arbitrates channel service requests in two groups (0, 1). For the MPC5553/MPC5554, group 0 contains channels 0-15 and group 1 contains channels 16-31; but for the MPC5554 only, group 2 contains channels 32-47, and group 3 contains channels 48-63.\n\nArbitration within a group can be configured to use either a fixed priority or a round robin.    In fixed priority arbitration, the highest priority channel requesting service is selected to execute. The priorities are assigned  by  the  channel  priority  registers  (see  Section 9.3.1.15).  In  round  robin  arbitration  mode,  the channel priorities are ignored and the channels within each group are cycled through, from channel 15 down to channel 0,  without regard to priority.\n\nThe group priorities operate in a similar fashion. In group fixed priority arbitration mode, channel service requests in the highest priority group are executed first where priority level 3 (in the MPC5554; priority level 1 for the MPC5553) is the highest and priority level 0 is the lowest. The group priorities are assigned in the GRP n PRI fields of the eDMA control register (EDMA\\_CR). All group priorities must have unique values prior to any channel service requests occur, otherwise a configuration error will be reported. In group round robin mode, the group priorities are ignored and the groups are cycled through, from group 3 down to group 0, without regard to priority.\n\nFigure 9-2. eDMA Control Register (EDMA\\_CR)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|          | 0             | 1             | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             | 6             | 7             | 8             | 9             | 10            | 11            | 12            | 13            | 14            | 15            |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| R        | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| W        |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Reset    | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 |\n|          | 16            | 17            | 18            | 19            | 20            | 21            | 22            | 23            | 24            | 25            | 26            | 27            | 28            | 29            | 30            | 31            |\n| R        | GRP3PRI 1     | GRP3PRI 1     | GRP2PRI 1     | GRP2PRI 1     | GRP1PRI 2     | GRP1PRI 2     | GRP0PRI 3     | GRP0PRI 3     | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | ERGA          | ERCA          | EDBG          | 0             |\n| W        |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Reset    | 1             | 1             | 1             | 0             | 0             | 1             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 | Base + 0x0000 |\n\n- 1 Available only in the MPC5554.\n- 2 In the MPC5553, only bit 21 is used\n- 3 In the MPC5553, only bit 23 is used\n\nTable 9-2.

The addresses and offsets must be aligned on 0-modulo-transfer\\_size boundaries, and the minor loop byte count must be a multiple  of  the  source  and  destination  transfer  sizes.  All  source  reads  and  destination  writes  must  be configured to the natural boundary of the programmed transfer size respectively.\n\nIn fixed arbitration mode, a configuration error is caused by any two channel priorities being equal within a  group,  or  any  group  priority  levels  being  equal  among  the  groups.  For  either  type  of  priority configuration error, the ERRCHN field is undefined. All channel priority levels within a group must be unique and all group priority levels among the groups must be unique when fixed arbitration mode is enabled.\n\nIf a scatter/gather operation is enabled upon channel completion, a configuration error is reported if the scatter/gather address (DLAST\\_SGA) is not aligned on a 32-byte boundary. If minor loop channel linking is enabled upon channel completion, a configuration error is reported when the link is attempted if the TCD.CITER.E\\_LINK bit does not equal the TCD.BITER.E\\_LINK bit. All configuration error conditions except scatter/gather and minor loop link error are reported as the channel is activated and assert an error interrupt request if enabled. When properly enabled, a scatter/gather configuration error is reported when\n\nthe scatter/gather operation begins at major loop completion. A minor loop channel link configuration error is reported when the link operation is serviced at minor loop completion.\n\nIf a system bus read or write is terminated with an error, the data transfer is immediately stopped and the appropriate bus error flag is set. In this case, the state of the channel's transfer control descriptor is updated by the eDMA engine with the current source address, destination address, and minor loop byte count at the point of the fault. If a bus error occurs on the last read prior to beginning the write sequence, the write will execute using the data captured during the bus error. If a bus error occurs on the last write prior to switching to the next read sequence, the read sequence will execute before the channel is terminated due to the destination bus error.\n\nThe occurrence of any type of error causes the eDMA engine to stop the active channel, and the appropriate channel bit in the eDMA error register to be asserted. At the same time, the details of the error condition are  loaded  into  the  EDMA\\_ESR.  The  major  loop  complete    indicators,  setting  the  transfer  control descriptor DONE flag and the possible assertion of an interrupt request, are not affected when an error is detected. Once the error status has been updated, the eDMA engine continues to operate by servicing the next appropriate channel. A channel that experiences an error condition is not automatically disabled. If a channel is terminated by an error and then issues another service request before the error is fixed, that channel will execute and terminate with the same error condition.\n\nFigure 9-3. eDMA Error Status Register (EDMA\\_ESR)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|          | 0             | 1             | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             | 6             | 7             | 8             | 9             | 10            | 11            | 12            | 13            | 14            | 15            |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| R        | VLD           | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| W        |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Reset    | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 |\n|          | 16            | 17            | 18            | 19            | 20            | 21            | 22            | 23            | 24            | 25            | 26            | 27            | 28            | 29            | 30            | 31            |\n| R        | GPE           | CPE           | ERRCHN        | ERRCHN        | ERRCHN        | ERRCHN        | ERRCHN        | ERRCHN        | SAE           | SOE           | DAE           | DOE           | NCE           | SGE           | SBE           | DBE           |\n| W        |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Reset    | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 | Base + 0x0004 |\n\nTable 9-3.

The state of the eDMA enable request flag does not affect a channel service request made explicitly through software or a linked channel request.\n\nFigure 9-5. eDMA Enable Request Low Register (EDMA\\_ERQRL)\n\n|          | 0             | 1             | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5             | 6             | 7             | 8             | 9             | 10            | 11            | 12            | 13            | 14            | 15            |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| R W      | ERQ 63        | ERQ 62        | ERQ 61        | ERQ 60        | ERQ 59        | ERQ 58        | ERQ 57        | ERQ 56        | ERQ 55        | ERQ 54        | ERQ 53        | ERQ 52        | ERQ 51        | ERQ 50        | ERQ 49        | ERQ 48        |\n| Reset    | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 |\n|          | 16            | 17            | 18            | 19            | 20            | 21            | 22            | 23            | 24            | 25            | 26            | 27            | 28            | 29            | 30            | 31            |\n| R W      | ERQ 47        | ERQ 46        | ERQ 45        | ERQ 44        | ERQ 43        | ERQ 42        | ERQ 41        | ERQ 40        | ERQ 39        | ERQ 38        | ERQ 37        | ERQ 36        | ERQ 35        | ERQ 34        | ERQ 33        | ERQ 32        |\n| Reset    | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Reg Addr | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 | Base + 0x0008 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 9-4.

GRPPRI bits are not affected by writes to the EDMA\\_CPR n registers.  The  group  priority  is  assigned  in  the  EDMA\\_CR.  See  Figure 9-2  and  Table 9-2  for  the EDMA\\_CR definition.\n\nChannel preemption is enabled on a per-channel basis by setting the ECP bit in the EDMA\\_CPR n register. Channel preemption allows the executing channel's data transfers to be temporarily suspended in favor of starting a higher priority channel. Once the preempting channel has completed all of its minor loop data transfers, the preempted channel is restored and resumes execution. After the restored channel completes one read/write sequence, it is again eligible for preemption. If any higher priority channel is requesting service, the restored channel will be suspended and the higher priority channel will be serviced. Nested preemption (attempting to preempt a preempting channel) is not supported. Once a preempting channel begins execution, it cannot be preempted. Preemption is only available when fixed arbitration is selected for both group and channel arbitration modes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 The reset value for the group and channel priority fields, GRPPRI[0-1] and CHPRI[0-3], is equal to the corresponding channel number for each priority register; that is, EDMA\\_CPR31[GRPPRI] = 0b01 and EDMA\\_CPR31[CHPRI] = 0b1111.\n\nFigure 9-20. eDMA Channel n Priority Register (EDMA\\_CPR n )\n\nTable 9-16.

The setting of this field provides the ability to easily implement a circular data queue. For data queues requiring power-of-2 'size' bytes, the queue should start at a 0-modulo-size address and the SMOD field should be set to the appropriate value for the queue, freezing the desired number of upper address bits. The value programmed into this field specifies the number of lower address bits that are allowed to change. For this circular queue application, the SOFF is typically set to the transfer size to implement post-increment addressing with the SMOD function constraining the addresses to a 0-modulo-size range. |\n| 37-39 / 0x4 [5:7]          | SSIZE [0:2]   | Source data transfer size. 000 8-bit 001 16-bit 010 32-bit 011 64-bit 100 Reserved 101 32-byte burst (64-bit x 4) 110 Reserved 111 Reserved The attempted specification of a 'reserved' encoding will cause a configuration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 40-44 / 0x4 [8:12]         | DMOD [0:4]    | Destination address modulo.

Number of bytes to be transferred in each service request of the channel. As a channel is activated, the contents of the appropriate TCD is loaded into the eDMA engine, and the appropriate reads and writes performed until the complete byte transfer count has been transferred. This is an indivisible operation and cannot be stalled or halted. Once the minor count is exhausted, the current values of the SADDR and DADDR are written back into the local memory, the major iteration count is decremented and restored to the local memory. If the major iteration count is completed, additional processing is performed.

As the channel completes the outer major loop, this flag enables the linking to another channel, defined by MAJOR.LINKCH[0:5]. The link target channel initiates a channel service request via an internal mechanism that sets the TCD.START bit of the specified channel. NOTE: To support the dynamic linking coherency model, this field is forced to zero when written to while the TCD.DONE bit is set. 0 The channel-to-channel linking is disabled. 1 The channel-to-channel linking is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| 251 / 0x1C [27]            | E_SG         | Enable scatter/gather processing. As the channel completes the outer major loop, this flag enables scatter/gather processing in the current channel. If enabled, the eDMA engine uses DLAST_SGA as a memory pointer to a 0-modulo-32 address containing a 32-byte data structure which is loaded as the transfer control descriptor into the local memory. NOTE: To support the dynamic scatter/gather coherency model, this field is forced to zero when written to while the TCD.DONE bit is set. 0 The current channel's TCD is 'normal' format. 1 The current channel's TCD specifies a scatter gather format. The DLAST_SGA field provides a memory pointer to the next TCD to be loaded into this channel after the outer major loop completes its execution.                          |\n| 252 / 0x1C [28]            | D_REQ        | Disable hardware request. If this flag is set, the eDMA hardware automatically clears the corresponding EDMA_ERQH or EDMA_ERQL bit when the current major iteration count reaches zero. 0 The channel's EDMA_ERQH or EDMA_ERQL bit is not affected. 1 The channel's EDMA_ERQH or EDMA_ERQL bit is cleared when the outer major loop is complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 253 / 0x1C [29]            | INT_HALF     | Enable an interrupt when major counter is half complete. If this flag is set, the channel generates an interrupt request by setting the appropriate bit in the EDMA_ERQHor EDMA_ERQLwhen the current major iteration count reaches the halfway point. Specifically, the comparison performed by the eDMA engine is (CITER == (BITER >> 1)). This halfway point interrupt request is provided to support double-buffered (aka ping-pong) schemes, or other types of data movement where the processor needs an early indication of the transfer's progress. CITER = BITER = 1 with INT_HALF enabled will generate an interrupt as it satisfies the equation (CITER == (BITER >> 1)) after a single activation. 0 The half-point interrupt is disabled. 1 The half-point interrupt is enabled. |\n\nTable 9-18.

Additionally,  the  eDMA  engine  is  further  partitioned  into  four  submodules, which are detailed below.\n\n- \u00b7 eDMA engine\n- - Address path: This module implements registered versions of two channel transfer control descriptors: channel 'x' and channel 'y,' and is responsible for all the master bus address calculations. All the implemented channels provide the exact same functionality. This hardware structure allows the data transfers associated with one channel to be preempted after the completion of a read/write sequence if a higher priority channel service request is asserted while the first channel is active. Once a channel is activated, it runs until the minor loop is completed unless preempted by a higher priority channel. This capability provides a mechanism (optionally enabled by EDMA\\_CPR n [ECP]) where a large data move operation can be preempted to minimize the time another channel is blocked from execution.\n- When any other channel is activated, the contents of its transfer control descriptor is read from the local memory and loaded into the registers of the other address path channel{x,y}. Once the inner minor loop completes execution, the address path hardware writes the new values for the TCD .{SADDR, DADDR, CITER} back into the local memory. If the major iteration n count is exhausted, additional processing is performed, including the final address pointer updates, reloading the TCDn.CITER field, and a possible fetch of the next TCDn from memory as part of a scatter/gather operation.\n- - Data path: This module implements the actual bus master read/write datapath. It includes 32 bytes of register storage (matching the maximum transfer size) and the necessary mux logic to support any required data alignment. The system read data bus is the primary input, and the system write data bus is the primary output.\n- The address and data path modules directly support the 2-stage pipelined system bus. The address path module represents the 1st stage of the bus pipeline (the address phase), while the data path module implements the 2nd stage of the pipeline (the data phase)."

In the diagram, this example uses the assertion of the eDMA peripheral request signal to request service for channel n . Channel service request via software and the TCDn.START bit follows the same basic flow as an eDMA peripheral request. The eDMA peripheral request input signal is registered internally and then routed to through the eDMA engine, first through the control module, then into the program model/channel arbitration module. In the next cycle, the channel arbitration is performed, either using the fixed-priority or round-robin algorithm. After the arbitration is complete, the activated channel number is sent through the address path and converted into the required address to access the TCD local memory. Next, the TCD memory is accessed and the required descriptor read from the local memory and loaded into the eDMA engine address path channel{x,y} registers. The TCD memory is organized 64-bits in width to minimize the time needed to fetch the activated channel's descriptor and load it into the eDMA engine address path channel{x,y} registers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neDMA Done Handshake\n\nFigure 9-22. eDMA Operation, Part 1\n\nIn the second part of the basic data flow as shown in Figure 9-23, the modules associated with the data transfer (address path, data path and control) sequence through the required source reads and destination writes  to  perform  the  actual  data  movement.  The  source  reads  are  initiated  and  the  fetched  data  is temporarily stored in the data path module until it is gated onto the system bus during the destination write.\n\nThis  source  read/destination  write  processing  continues  until  the  inner  minor  byte  count  has  been transferred. The eDMA Done Handshake signal is asserted at the end of the minor byte count transfer.\n\nFigure 9-23. eDMA Operation, Part 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnce the inner minor byte count has been moved, the final phase of the basic data flow is performed. In this segment, the address path logic performs the required updates to certain fields in the channel's TCD: for example., SADDR, DADDR, CITER. If the outer major iteration count is exhausted, then there are additional operations which are performed. These include the final address adjustments and reloading of the BITER field into the CITER. Additionally, assertion of an optional interrupt request occurs at this time, as does a possible fetch of a new TCD from memory using the scatter/gather address pointer included in\n\nthe descriptor. The updates to the TCD memory and the assertion of an interrupt request are shown in Figure 9-24.\n\nFigure 9-24. eDMA Operation, Part 3\n\n<!-- image -->"

In the traditional data movement context, performance is best expressed as the peak data transfer rates achieved using the eDMA. In most implementations, this transfer rate is limited by the speed of the source and destination  address  spaces.  In  a  second  context  where  device-paced  movement  of  single  data  values to/from peripherals is dominant, a measure of the requests that can be serviced in a fixed time is a more useful  metric.  In  this  environment,  the  speed  of  the  source  and  destination  address  spaces  remains important, but the microarchitecture of the eDMA also factors significantly into the resulting metric.\n\nThe peak transfer rates for several different source and destination transfers are shown in Table 9-19. The following assumptions apply to Table 9-19 and Table 9-20:\n\n- \u00b7 Internal SRAM can be accessed with zero wait-states when viewed from the system bus data phase.\n- \u00b7 All slave reads require two wait-states, and slave writes three wait-states, again viewed from the system bus data phase.\n- \u00b7 All slave accesses are 32-bits in size.\n\nTable 9-19 presents a peak transfer rate comparison, measured in Mbytes per second."

For all transfers involving the slave bus, 32-bit transfer sizes are used. In all cases, the transfer rate includes the time to read the source plus the time to write the destination.\n\nThe second performance metric is a measure of the number of DMA requests that can be serviced in a given amount of time. For this metric, it is assumed the peripheral request causes the channel to move a single slave-mapped operand to/from internal SRAM. The same timing assumptions used in the previous example apply to this calculation. In particular, this metric also reflects the time required to activate the channel. The eDMA design supports the following hardware service request sequence:\n\n- \u00b7 Cycle 1: eDMA peripheral request is asserted.\n- \u00b7 Cycle 2: The eDMA peripheral request is registered locally in the eDMA module and qualified. (TCD.START bit initiated requests start at this point with the registering of the slave write to TCD bit 255).\n- \u00b7 Cycle 3: Channel arbitration begins.\n- \u00b7 Cycle 4: Channel arbitration completes. The transfer control descriptor local memory read is initiated.\n- \u00b7 Cycle 5 - 6: The first two parts of the activated channel's TCD is read from the local memory. The memory width to the eDMA engine is 64 bits, so the entire descriptor can be accessed in four cycles.\n- \u00b7 Cycle 7: The first system bus read cycle is initiated, as the third part of the channel's TCD is read from the local memory. Depending on the state of the  crossbar switch, arbitration at the system bus may insert an additional cycle of delay here.\n- : The last part of the TCD is read in. This cycle represents the 1st data phase for the\n- \u00b7 Cycle 8 n read, and the address phase for the destination write.\n- The exact timing from this point is a function of the response times for the channel's read and write accesses. In this case of an slave read and internal SRAM write, the combined data phase time is 4 cycles. For an SRAM read and slave write, it is 5 cycles.\n- \u00b7 Cycle n + 1: This cycle represents the data phase of the last destination write.\n- \u00b7 Cycle n + 2: The eDMA engine completes the execution of the inner minor loop and prepares to write back the required TCDn fields into the local memory. The control/status fields at word offset\n\n0x1C in TCDn are read. If the major loop is complete, the MAJOR.E\\_LINK and E\\_SG bits are checked and processed if enabled.\n\n- \u00b7 Cycle n + 3: The appropriate fields in the first part of the TCDn are written back into the local memory.\n- \u00b7 Cycle n + 4: The fields in the second part of the TCDn are written back into the local memory. This cycle coincides with the next channel arbitration cycle start.\n- \u00b7 Cycle n + 5: The next channel to be activated performs the read of the first part of its TCD from the local memory. This is equivalent to Cycle 4 for the first channel's service request.\n\nAssuming zero wait states on the system bus, DMA requests can be processed every 9 cycles. Assuming an average of the access times associated with slave-to-SRAM (4 cycles) and SRAM-to-slave (5 cycles), DMA requests can be processed every 11.5 cycles (4 + (4+5)/2 + 3). This is the time from Cycle 4 to Cycle ' n + 5.' The resulting peak request rate, as a function of the system frequency, is shown in Table 9-20. This metric represents millions of requests per second."

Most programming errors are reported on a per channel basis with the exception of two errors: group priority error and channel priority error, or EDMA\\_ESR[GPE] and EDMA\\_ESR[CPE], respectively.\n\nFor all error types other than group or channel priority errors, the channel number causing the error is recorded in the EDMA\\_ESR. If the error source is not removed before the next activation of the problem channel, the error will be detected and recorded again.\n\nChannel priority errors are identified within a group once that group has been selected as the active group. For the example below, all of the channel priorities in group 1 are unique, but some of the channel priorities in group 0 are the same:\n\n- 1. The eDMA is configured for fixed group and fixed channel arbitration modes.\n- 2. Group 1 is the highest priority and all channels are unique in that group.\n- 3. Group 0 is the next highest priority and has two channels with the same priority level.\n- 4. If group 1 has any service requests, those requests will be executed.\n- 5. Once all of group 1 requests have completed, group 0 will be the next active group.\n- 6. If Group 0 has a service request, then an undefined channel in group 0 will be selected and a channel priority error will occur.\n- 7. This will repeat until the all of group 0 requests have been removed or a higher priority group 1 request comes in.\n\nIn  this  sequence,  for  item  2,  the  eDMA  acknowledge lines  will  assert  only  if  the  selected  channel  is requesting service via the eDMA peripheral request signal. If interrupts are enabled for all channels, the user will receive an error interrupt, but the channel number for the EDMA\\_ER and the error interrupt request line are undetermined because they reflect the 'undefined' channel. A group priority error is global and any request in any group will cause a group priority error.\n\nIf priority levels are not unique, the highest (channel/group) priority that has an active request will be selected, but the lowest numbered (channel/group) with that priority will be selected by arbitration and executed by the eDMA engine. The hardware service request handshake signals, error interrupts and error reporting will be associated with the selected channel."

If the eDMA is programmed so the channels within one group use 'fixed' priorities, and that group is assigned the highest 'fixed' priority of all groups, it is possible for that group to take all the bandwidth of the eDMA controller; that is, no other groups will be serviced if there is always at least one DMA request pending on a channel in the highest priority group when the controller arbitrates the next DMA request. The advantage of this scenario is that latency can be small for channels that need to be serviced quickly. Preemption is available in this scenario only."

Servicing  continues  round  robin,  always servicing the highest priority channel in the next group in the sequence, or just skipping a group if it has no pending requests.\n\nIf a channel requests service at a rate that equals or exceeds the round robin service rate, then that channel will always be serviced before lower priority channels in the same group, and thus the lower priority channels will never be serviced. The advantage of this scenario is that no one group will consume all the eDMA bandwidth. The highest priority channel selection latency is potentially greater than fixed/fixed arbitration. Excessive request rates on high priority channels could prevent the servicing of lower priority channels in the same group."

Any DMA requests that are not serviced are simply lost, but at least one channel will be serviced.\n\nThis scenario ensures that all channels will be guaranteed service at some point, regardless of the request rates.

    "content": "The modulo feature of the eDMA provides the ability to easily implement a circular data queue in which the size of the queue is a power of 2.  MOD is a 5-bit bitfield for both the source and destination in the TCD, and it specifies which lower address bits are allowed to increment from their original value after the address + offset calculation.  All upper address bits remain the same as in the original value. A setting of 0 for this field disables the modulo feature.\n\nTable 9-23 shows how the transfer addresses are specified based on the setting of the MOD field. Here a circular buffer is created where the address wraps to the original value while the 28 upper address bits (0x1234567x) retain their original value. In this example the source address is set to 0x12345670, the offset is set to 4 bytes and the mod field is set to 4, allowing for a 2 4 byte (16-byte) size queue.\n\nTable 9-23.

Another method may be extracted from  the  sequence  shown  below.  The  second  method  is  to  test  the  TCD.START  bit  AND  the TCD.ACTIVE bit. The minor loop complete condition is indicated by both bits reading zero after the TCD.START was written to a one. Polling the TCD.ACTIVE bit may be inconclusive because the active status may be missed if the channel execution is short in duration.\n\nThe TCD status bits execute the following sequence for a software activated channel:\n\n- 1. TCD.START = 1, TCD.ACTIVE = 0, TCD.DONE = 0 (channel service request via software)\n- 2. TCD.START = 0, TCD.ACTIVE = 1, TCD.DONE = 0 (channel is executing)\n- 3.

These bits are read from the TCD local memory at the end of channel execution thus allowing the user to enable either feature during channel execution.\n\nBecause the user is allowed to change the configuration during execution, a coherency model is needed. Consider  the  scenario  where  the  user  attempts  to  execute  a  dynamic  channel  link  by  enabling  the TCD.MAJOR.E\\_LINK  bit  at  the  same  time the eDMA  engine  is retiring the channel. The TCD.MAJOR.E\\_LINK would be set in the programmer's model, but it would be unclear whether the actual link was made before the channel retired.\n\nThe following coherency model is recommended when executing a dynamic channel link or dynamic scatter/gather request:\n\n- 1. Set the TCD.MAJOR.E\\_LINK bit\n- 2. Read back the TCD.MAJOR.E\\_LINK bit\n- 3. Test the TCD.MAJOR.E\\_LINK request status:\n- a) If the bit is set, the dynamic link attempt was successful.\n\n- b) If the bit is cleared, the attempted dynamic link did not succeed, the channel was already retiring.\n\nThis same coherency model is true for dynamic scatter/gather operations. For both dynamic requests, the TCD local memory controller forces the TCD.MAJOR.E\\_LINK and TCD.E\\_SG bits to zero on any writes to a channel's TCD once that channel's TCD.DONE bit is set indicating the major loop is complete."
