The FlexCAN2 module is a full implementation  of  the  CAN  protocol  specification,  Version  2.0  B,  which  supports  both  standard  and extended message frames. Sixty-four message buffers (MBs) are stored in an embedded 1024-byte RAM dedicated to the FlexCAN2 module.\n\nThe CAN protocol interface (CPI) manages the serial communication on the CAN bus, requesting RAM access for receiving and transmitting message frames, validating received messages and performing error handling. The message buffer management (MBM) handles message buffer selection for reception and transmission, taking care of arbitration and ID matching algorithms. The bus interface unit (BIU) controls the access to and from the internal interface bus, in order to establish connection to the CPU and to any other modules. Clocks, address and data buses, interrupt outputs and test signals are accessed through the bus interface unit."

This 4-bit field can be accessed (read or write) by the CPU and by the FlexCAN2 module itself, as part of the message buffer matching and arbitration process. The encoding is shown in Table 22-5 and Table 22-6. See Section 22.4, 'Functional Description,' for additional information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| SRR        | Substitute remote request. Fixed recessive bit, used only in extended format. It must be set to '1' by the user for transmission (TX Buffers) and will be stored with the value received on the CANbus for RX receiving buffers. It can be received as either recessive or dominant. If FlexCAN2 receives this bit as dominant, then it is interpreted as arbitration loss. 0 Dominant is not a valid value for transmission in extended format frames 1 Recessive value is compulsory for transmission in extended format frames                                                                  |\n| IDE        | ID extended bit. This bit identifies whether the frame format is standard or extended. 0 Frame format is standard 1 Frame format is extended                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| RTR        | Remote transmission request. This bit is used for requesting transmissions of a data frame. If FlexCAN2 transmits this bit as '1' (recessive) and receives it as '0' (dominant), it is interpreted as arbitration loss. If this bit is transmitted as '0' (dominant), then if it is received as '1' (recessive), the FlexCAN2 module treats it as bit error. If the value received matches the value transmitted, it is considered as a successful bit transmission. 0 Indicates the current MB has a data frame to be transmitted 1 Indicates the current MB has a remote frame to be transmitted |\n| LENGTH     | Length of data in bytes. This 4-bit field is the length (in bytes) of the RXor TX data, which is located in offset 0x8 through 0xF of the MBspace (see Figure 22-2). In reception, this field is written by the FlexCAN2 module, copied from the DLC (data length code) field of the received frame. In transmission, this field is written by the CPU and corresponds to the DLC field value of the frame to be transmitted. When RTR = 1, the Frame to be transmitted is a remote frame and does not include the data field, regardless of the length field.                                     |\n| TIME STAMP | Free-running counter time stamp. This 16-bit field is a copy of the free-running timer, captured for Tx and Rx frames at the time when the beginning of the Identifier field appears on the CAN bus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ID         | Frame identifier. In standard frame format, only the 11 most significant bits (28 to 18) are used for frame identification in both receive and transmit cases. The 18 least significant bits are ignored. In extended frame format, all bits are used for frame identification in both receive and transmit cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| DATA       | Data field. Up to eight bytes can be used for a data frame. For RX frames, the data is stored as it is received from the CAN bus. For TX frames, the CPU prepares the data field to be transmitted within the frame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\nTable 22-5.

When the frame is eventually transmitted successfully, the Code automatically returns to '1010' to restart the process again. |\n|     0 |              1110 |                                 1010 | the MBM as a result of match to a remote request frame. The data frame will be transmitted unconditionally once and then the code will automatically return to '1010'. The CPU can also write this code with the same effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |"

The following registers are affected by soft reset: GLYPH<127> CAN x _MCR (except the MDIS bit), GLYPH<127> CAN x _TIMER, GLYPH<127> CAN x _ECR, GLYPH<127> CAN x _ESR, GLYPH<127> CAN x _IMRL, GLYPH<127> CAN x _IMRH, GLYPH<127> CAN x _IFRL, GLYPH<127> CAN x _IFRH. Configuration registers that control the interface to the CAN bus are not affected by soft reset. The following registers are unaffected: GLYPH<127> CANx_CR GLYPH<127> CAN x _RXGMASK GLYPH<127> CAN x _RX14MASK GLYPH<127> CAN x _RX15MASK GLYPH<127> all Message buffers The SOFTRST bit can be asserted directly by the CPU when it writes to the CAN x _MCR, but it is also asserted when global soft reset is requested at MCUlevel. Because soft reset is synchronous and has to follow a request/acknowledge procedure across clock domains, it may take some time to fully propagate its effect. The SOFTRST bit remains asserted while reset is pending, and is automatically negated when reset completes. Therefore, software can poll this bit to know when the soft reset has completed. 0 No reset request 1 Resets values in registers indicated above. |\n| 7      | FRZACK      | Freeze mode acknowledge. Indicates that FlexCAN2 is in freeze mode and its prescaler is stopped. The freeze mode request cannot be granted until current transmission and reception processes have finished. Therefore the software can poll the FRZACK bit to know when FlexCAN2 has actually entered freeze mode. If freeze mode request is negated, then this bit is negated once the FlexCAN2 prescaler is running again. If freeze mode is requested while FlexCAN2 is disabled, then the FRZACK bit will only be set when the low power mode is exited.

Defines how FlexCAN2 recovers from bus off state. If this bit is negated, automatic recovering from bus off state occurs according to the CAN Specification 2.0B. If the bit is asserted, automatic recovering from bus off is disabled and the module remains in bus off state until the bit is negated by the user. If the negation occurs before 128 sequences of 11 recessive bits are detected on the CANbus, then bus off recovery happens as if the BOFFREC bit had never been asserted. If the negation occurs after 128 sequences of 11 recessive bits occurred, then FlexCAN2 will re-synchronize to the bus by waiting for 11 recessive bits before joining the bus. After negation, the BOFFREC bit can be re-asserted again during bus off, but it will only be effective the next time the module enters bus off. If BOFFREC was negated when the module entered bus off, asserting it during bus off will not be effective for the current bus off recovery. 0 Automatic recovering from bus off state enabled, according to CAN Spec 2.0 part B 1 Automatic recovering from bus off state disabled |\n| 26     | TSYN        | Timer sync mode.

    "content": "CAN \\_TIMER represents a 16-bit free running counter that can be read and written by the CPU. The timer x starts from 0x0000 after Reset, counts linearly to 0xFFFF, and wraps around.\n\nThe timer is clocked by the FlexCAN2 bit-clock (which defines the baud rate on the CAN bus). During a message transmission/reception, it increments by one for each bit that is received or transmitted. When there is no message on the bus, it counts using the previously programmed baud rate. During freeze mode, the timer is not incremented.\n\nThe timer value is captured at the beginning of the identifier field of any frame on the CAN bus. This captured value is written into the TIME STAMP entry in a message buffer after a successful reception or transmission of a message.\n\nWriting to the timer is an indirect operation. The data is first written to an auxiliary register and then an internal request/acknowledge procedure across clock domains is executed.

    ],
    "chunk_type": "register_diagram",
    "content": "CAN \\_ECR has two 8-bit fields reflecting the value of two FlexCAN2 error counters: the transmit error x counter  (TXECTR  field)  and  receive  error  counter  (RXECTR  field) . The  rules  for  increasing  and decreasing  these  counters  are  described  in  the  CAN  protocol  and  are  completely  implemented  in  the FlexCAN2 module. Both counters are read only except in freeze mode, where they can be written by the CPU.\n\nWriting to the CAN \\_ECR while in freeze mode is an indirect operation. The data is first written to an x auxiliary register and then an internal request/acknowledge procedure across clock domains is executed. All this is transparent to the user, except for the fact that the data will take some time to be actually written to the register. If desired, software can poll the register to discover when the data was actually written.\n\nFlexCAN2 responds to any bus state as described in the protocol: transmitting, for example, an 'error active'  or  'error  passive'  flag,  delaying  its  transmission  start  time  ('error  passive'),  and  avoiding  any influence on the bus when in the bus off state. The following are the basic rules for FlexCAN2 bus state transitions:\n\n- \u00b7 If the value of TXECTR or RXECTR increases to be greater than or equal to 128, the FLTCONF field in the CAN x \\_ESR is updated to reflect the 'error passive' state.\n- \u00b7 If the FlexCAN2 state is 'error passive,' and either TXECTR or RXECTR decrements to a value less than or equal to 127 while the other already satisfies this condition, the FLTCONF field in the CAN \\_ESR is updated to reflect the 'error active' state. x\n- \u00b7 If the value of TXECTR increases to be greater than 255, the FLTCONF field in the CAN x \\_ESR is updated to reflect the bus off state, and an interrupt may be issued. The value of TXECTR is then reset to zero.\n- \u00b7 If FlexCAN2 is in the bus off state, then TXECTR is cascaded together with another internal counter to count the 128th occurrences of 11 consecutive recessive bits on the bus. Hence, TXECTR is reset to zero and counts in a manner where the internal counter counts 11 such bits and then wraps around while incrementing the TXECTR. When TXECTR reaches the value of 128, the FLTCONF field in CAN \\_ESR is updated to be 'error active' and both error counters are reset to x zero. At any instance of dominant bit following a stream of less than 11 consecutive recessive bits, the internal counter resets itself to zero without affecting the TXECTR value.\n- \u00b7 If during system start-up, only one node is operating, then its TXECTR increases in each message it is trying to transmit, as a result of acknowledge errors (indicated by the ACKERR bit in\n\nCAN \\_ESR). After the transition to the 'error passive' state, the TXECTR does not increment x anymore by acknowledge errors. Therefore the device never goes to the bus off state.\n\n- \u00b7 If the RXECTR increases to a value greater than 127, it is not incremented further, even if more errors are detected while being a receiver. At the next successful message reception, the counter is set to a value between 119 and 127 to resume to 'error active' state.\n\nFigure 22-7.

The  CPU  read  action  clears  BIT1ERR,  BIT0ERR,  ACKERR,  CRCERR, FRMERR, and STFERR.  TXWRN, RXWRN, IDLE, TXRX, FLTCONF, BOFFINT, and ERRINT are status bits.\n\nMost bits in this register are read-only, except BOFFINT and ERRINT, which are interrupt flags that can be cleared by writing 1 to them (writing 0 has no effect).

The selected MB will be transferred to an internal serial message buffer (SMB), which is not x user accessible, and then transmitted.\n\nThe arbitration process is triggered in the following events:\n\n- \u00b7 During the CRC field of the CAN frame\n- \u00b7 During the error delimiter field of the CAN frame\n- \u00b7 During Intermission, if the winner MB defined in a previous arbitration was deactivated, or if there was no MB to transmit, but the CPU wrote to the C/S word of any MB after the previous arbitration finished\n- \u00b7 When MBM is in idle or bus off state and the CPU writes to the C/S word of any MB\n- \u00b7 Upon leaving freeze mode\n\nWhen the arbitration is over, and there is a winner MB for transmission, the frame is transferred to the SMB for  transmission.  This  is  called  'move  out.'  After  move  out,  the  CAN  transmit  machine  will  start  to transmit the frame according to the CAN protocol rules.

    "chunk_type": "list",
    "content": "After a MB is marked as 'RX active and empty,' it will participate in the internal matching process, which takes place every time the receiver receives an error free frame. In this process, all active RX buffers compare their ID value to the newly received one, and if a match occurs, the frame is transferred (move in) to the first (that is, lowest entry) matching MB. The value of the free running timer is written into the TIME STAMP field in the MB. The ID field, the DATA field (8 bytes at most), and the LENGTH field are stored, the CODE field is updated, and a status flag is set in CAN x \\_IFRL or CAN \\_IFRH, and an interrupt x is generated if the corresponding interrupt mask is enabled in CAN x \\_IMRL/H.\n\nThe CPU should read an RX frame from its MB in the following way:\n\n- \u00b7 Control and status word (mandatory, activates internal lock for this buffer)\n- \u00b7 ID (optional, needed only if a mask was used)\n- \u00b7 DATA field words\n- \u00b7 Free running timer (optional, releases internal lock)\n\nReading the free running timer is not mandatory. If not executed, the MB remains locked, unless the CPU starts reading another MB. Note that only a single MB is locked at a time. The only mandatory CPU read operation is of the control and status word, to assure data coherency. If the BUSY bit is set in the CODE field, then the CPU should defer the access to the MB until this bit is negated.\n\nThe CPU should synchronize to frame reception by the status flag bit for the specific MB in one of the CANx\\_IFRH and CANx\\_IFRL registers and not by the control and status word code field of that MB. Polling the CODE field does not work because once a frame was received and the CPU services the MB (by reading the C/S word followed by unlocking the MB), the CODE field will not return to EMPTY. It will remain FULL, as explained in Table 22-5. If the CPU tries to workaround this behavior by writing to the C/S word to force an EMPTY code after reading the MB, the MB is actually deactivated from any currently ongoing matching process. As a result, a newly received frame matching the ID of that MB may be lost. In summary: never do polling by reading directly the C/S word of the MBs. Instead, read the CANx\\_IFRH and CANx\\_IFRL registers.\n\nNote that the received ID field is always stored in the matching MB, thus the contents of the ID field in a MB can change if the match was due to mask."

Any form of CPU accessing a MB structure within FlexCAN2 other than those specified can cause FlexCAN2 to behave in an unpredictable way.\n\nDeactivation of a message buffer is a CPU action that causes that MB to be excluded from FlexCAN2 transmit  or  receive  processes  during  the  current  match/arbitration  round.  Any  CPU  write  access  to  a control and status word of the MB structure deactivates that MB, excluding it from the current RX/TX process.  However,  deactivation  is  not  permanent.  The  MB  that  was  deactivated  during  the  current match/arbitration round will be available for transmission or reception in the next round.\n\nThe purpose of deactivation is data coherency. The match/arbitration process scans the MBs to decide which MB to transmit or receive. If the CPU updates the MB in the middle of a match or arbitration process, the data of that MB may no longer be coherent, therefore that MB is deactivated.\n\nMatch and arbitration are one-pass processes. After scanning all MBs, a winner is determined. If MBs are changed after they are scanned, no re-evaluation is done to determine a new match/winner; and a frame may be lost because the winner may have been deactivated. If two RX MBs have a matching ID to a received  frame,  then  it  is  not  guaranteed  reception  if  the  user  deactivated  the  matching  MB  after FlexCAN2 has scanned the second."

There is no indication in the CAN x \\_ESR of that situation.\n- \u00b7 If while a MB is locked, two or more RX frames with matching ID are received, then the last received one is kept within the SMB, while all preceding ones are lost. There is no indication that the preceding ones were lost in the CAN x \\_ESR.\n- \u00b7 If a locked MB is released, and there exists a matching frame within the SMB, this frame is then transferred to the matching MB.\n\n- \u00b7 If the CPU reads a RX MB while it is being transferred into (from) SMB, then the BUSY bit is set in the CODE field of the control and status word. In order to assure data coherency, the CPU should wait until this bit is negated before further reading from that MB. Note that in this case such MB is not locked.\n- \u00b7 If the CPU deactivates a locked RX MB, then its lock status is negated, but no data is transferred into that MB."

If there is a matching ID, then this MB frame will be transmitted. Note that if the matching MB has the RTR bit set, then FlexCAN2 will transmit a remote frame as a response.\n\nA received remote request frame is not stored in a receive buffer. It is only used to trigger a transmission of a frame in response. The mask registers are not used in remote frame matching, and all ID bits (except RTR) of the incoming received frame should match.\n\nIn the case that a remote request frame was received and matched a MB, this message buffer immediately enters the internal arbitration process, but is considered as normal TX MB, with no higher priority.

There is no distinction between TX and RX interrupts for a particular buffer, under x\n\nthe assumption that the buffer is initialized for either transmission or reception.

Therefore,  it  may  take  some  time  to  fully  propagate  its  effects.  The  SOFTRST  bit  remains asserted while soft reset is pending, so software can poll this bit to know when the reset has completed.\n\nAfter the module is enabled (CAN x \\_MCR[MDIS] bit negated), FlexCAN2 should be put into freeze mode before doing any configuration. In freeze mode, FlexCAN2 is un-synchronized to the CAN bus, the HALT and FRZ bits in CAN \\_MCR are set, the internal state machines are disabled and the FRZACK and x NOTRDY bits in the CAN \\_MCR are set. The CNTX pin is in recessive state and FlexCAN2 does not x initiate  frame  transmission  nor  receives  any  frames  from  the  CAN  bus.
