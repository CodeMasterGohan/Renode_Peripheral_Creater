Disabling the module turns off the clock to the module, although some of the module registers may be accessed by the core via the slave bus. The MDIS bit is intended to be used when the module is not required in the application."

TC is set low when there is a transmission in progress or when a preamble or break character is loaded. TC is set high when the TDRE flag is set and no data, preamble, or break character is being transmitted. When TC is set, the TXDout signal becomes idle (logic 1). After the device is switched on (by clearing the MDIS bit, see Section 21.3.3.2, 'eSCI Control Register 2 (ESCIx_CR2),' a preamble is transmitted; if no byte is written to the the SCI data register then the completion of the preamble can be monitored using the TC flag. Clear TC by writing 1 to it. 0 Transmission in progress 1 No transmission in progress. Indicates that TXD out is idle. |\n|      2 | RDRF   | Receive data register full flag.

IDLE is set when 10 consecutive logic 1s (if M=0) or 11 consecutive logic 1s (if M=1) appear on the receiver input. Once the IDLE flag is cleared, a valid frame must again set the RDRF flag before an idle condition can set the IDLE flag. Clear IDLE by writing 1 to it. 0 Receiver input is either active now or has never become active since the IDLE flag was last cleared 1 Receiver input has become idle Note: When the receiver wake-up bit (RWU) is set, an idle line condition does not set the IDLE flag.                                                                                                                                                                |\n\nTable 21-6.

OR is set when software fails to read the eSCI data register before the receive shift register receives the next frame. The ORbit is set immediately after the stop bit has been completely received for the second frame. The data in the shift register is lost, but the data already in the eSCI data registers is not affected. Clear OR by writing 1 to it. 0 No overrun 1 Overrun                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| 5      | NF     | Noise flag.

The first byte written to the register selects the x transmit address, the second byte determines the frame length, the third and fourth byte set various frame options  and  determine  the  timeout  counter.  Header  parity  will  be  automatically  generated  if  the ESCI \\_LCR[PRTY] bit is set. For TX frames, the fourth byte (bits T7-T0) is skipped, since the timeout x function does not apply. All following bytes are data bytes for the frame. CRC and checksum bytes will be automatically appended when the appropriate options are selected.\n\nWhen a bit error is detected, an interrupt is set and the transmission aborted. The register can only be written again once the interrupt is cleared. Afterwards a new frame starts, and the first byte needs to contain a header again.\n\nAdditionally it is possible to flush the ESCI x \\_LTR by setting the ESCI x \\_LCR[LRES] bit."

Sets the counter to determine a NO_RESPONSE_ERROR, if the frame is a read access to a LIN slave. Following LIN standard rev 1.3, the value (10 \u00d7 N DATA + 45) \u00d7 1.4 is recommended. For transmissions, this counter has to be set to 0. The timeout bits 7-0 will not be written on a TX frame. For TX frames, the fourth byte written to the LIN transmit register (ESCI x _LTR) is the first data byte, for RX frames it contains timeout bits 7-0.The time is specified in multiples of bit times. The timeout period starts with the transmission of the LIN break character. |\n| 8-31   | -      | Reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |"

Sets the counter to determine a NO_RESPONSE_ERROR, if the frame is a read access to a LIN slave. Following LIN standard rev 1.3, the value (10 \u00d7 N DATA + 45) \u00d7 1.4 is recommended. For transmissions, this counter has to be set to 0. The timeout bits 7-0 will not be written on a TX frame. For TX frames, the fourth byte written to the LIN transmit register (ESCI x _LTR) is the first data byte. For RX frames, it contains timeout bits 7-0.The time is specified in multiples of bit times. The timeout period starts with the transmission of the LIN break character. |\n| 8-31   | -      | Reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\nTable 21-12.

Provides received data bytes from RX frames. Data is only valid when the ESCI x _SR[RXRDY] flag is set. CRC and checksum information will not be available in the ESCI x _LRR unless they are treated as data. It is possible to treat CRC and checksum bytes as data by deactivating the CSUM respectively CRC control bits in the ESCI x _LTR; however, then CRC and CSUM checking has to be performed by software. Data bytes must be read from the ESCI x _LRR (by CPU or DMA) before any new bytes (including CRCor checksum) are received from the LIN bus otherwise the data byte is lost and OVFL is set. Note: The data must be collected and the LIN frame finished (including CRC and checksum if applicable) before a wake-up character can be sent. |\n| 8-31   | -      | Reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |"

The eSCI allows full duplex, asynchronous, NRZ serial communication between the CPU and remote devices, including other CPUs. The eSCI transmitter and receiver operate independently, although they use the same baud rate generator. The CPU monitors the status of the eSCI, writes the data to be transmitted, and processes received data.\n\nFigure 21-11. eSCI Operation Block Diagram\n\n<!-- image -->"

    "content": "To transmit data, the MCU writes the data bits to the eSCI data register (ESCI x \\_DR), which in turn are transferred to the transmit shift register. The transmit shift register then shifts a frame out through the TXD signal, after it has prefaced them with a start bit and appended them with a stop bit. The eSCI data register (ESCI \\_DR) is the buffer (write-only during transmit) between the internal data bus and the transmit shift x register.\n\nThe eSCI also sets a flag, the transmit data register empty flag (TDRE), every time it transfers data from the buffer (ESCI x \\_DR) to the transmit shift register. The transmit driver routine may respond to this flag by writing another byte to the transmitter buffer (ESCI x \\_DR), while the shift register is still shifting out the first byte.\n\nTo initiate an eSCI transmission:\n\n- 1. Configure the eSCI:\n- a) Turn on the module by clearing ESCI x \\_CR2[MDIS] if this bit is set.\n- b) Select a baud rate. Write this value to the eSCI control register 1 (ESCI x \\_CR1) to start the baud rate generator. Remember that the baud rate generator is disabled when the ESCI \\_CR1[SBR] field is zero. When using 8-bit writes, writes to the ESCI x x \\_CR1[0-7] have no effect without also writing to ESCI x \\_CR1[8-15].\n- c) Write to ESCIx\\_CR1 to configure word length, parity, and other configuration bits (LOOPS, RSRC, M, WAKE, ILT, PE, PT).\n- d) Enable the transmitter, interrupts, receive, and wake-up as required, by writing to the ESCI \\_CR1 register bits (TIE, TCIE, RIE, ILIE, TE, RE, RWU, SBK). A preamble or idle x character will now be shifted out of the transmitter shift register.\n- 2. Transmit procedure for each byte:\n- a) Poll the TDRE flag by reading the ESCI x \\_SR or responding to the TDRE interrupt. Keep in mind that the TDRE bit resets to 1.\n- b) If the TDRE flag is set, write the data to be transmitted to ESCI x \\_DR, where the ninth bit is written to the T8 bit in ESCI x \\_DR if the eSCI is in 9-bit data format. A new transmission will not result until the TDRE flag has been cleared.\n- 3. Repeat step 2 for each subsequent transmission."

    "content": "The TDRE flag is set when the shift register is loaded with the next data to be  transmitted  from  ESCI x \\_DR,  which  occurs  approximately  half-way through the stop bit of the previous frame. Specifically, this transfer occurs 9/16ths of a bit time AFTER the start of the stop bit of the previous frame.\n\nToggling the TE bit from 0 to 1 automatically loads the transmit shift register with a preamble of 10 logic 1s (if M = 0) or 11 logic 1s (if M = 1). After the preamble shifts out, control logic transfers the data from the eSCI data register into the transmit shift register. A logic 0 start bit automatically goes into the least\n\nsignificant bit position of the transmit shift register. A logic 1 stop bit goes into the most significant bit position.\n\nThe eSCI hardware supports odd or even parity. When parity is enabled, the most significant bit (Msb) of the data character is the parity bit.\n\nThe transmit data register empty flag, TDRE, in the eSCI status register (ESCI x \\_SR) becomes set when the eSCI data register transfers a byte to the transmit shift register. The TDRE flag indicates that the eSCI data register can accept new data from the internal data bus. If the transmit interrupt enable bit, TIE, in eSCI control register 1 (ESCI x \\_CR1) is also set, the TDRE flag generates a transmitter interrupt request.\n\nWhen the transmit shift register is not transmitting a frame, the TXD output goes to the idle condition, logic 1. If at any time software clears the TE bit in eSCI control register 1 (ESCI x \\_CR1), the transmitter enable signal goes low and the TXD output goes idle.\n\nIf software clears TE while a transmission is in progress (ESCI x \\_CR1[TC] = 0), the frame in the transmit shift register continues to shift out. To avoid accidentally cutting off the last frame in a message, always wait for TDRE to go high after the last frame before clearing TE.\n\nTo separate messages with preambles with minimum idle line time, use the following sequence between messages:\n\n- 1. Write the last byte of the first message to ESCI x \\_DR.\n- 2. Wait for the TDRE flag to go high, indicating the transfer of the last frame to the transmit shift register.\n- 3. Queue a preamble by clearing and then setting the TE bit.\n- 4. Write the first byte of the second message to ESCI x \\_DR."

Fast Bit Error Detection on a LIN Bus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf fast bit error detection is enabled (FBR = 1), the eSCI will compare the transmitted and the received data stream when the transmitter is active (not idle). Once a mismatch between the transmitted data and the received data is detected the following actions are performed:\n\n- \u00b7 The LIN frame is aborted (provided LDBG=0).\n- \u00b7 The bit error flag BERR will be set.\n- \u00b7 If SBSTP is 0, the remainder of the byte will be transmitted normally.\n- \u00b7 If SBSTP is 1, the remaining bits in the byte after the error bit are transmitted as 1s (idle).\n\nTo adjust to different bus loads the sample point at which the incoming bit is compared to the one which was transmitted can be selected with the BESM13 bit (see Figure 21-15). If set, the comparison will be performed at RT clock 13, otherwise at RT clock 9 (also see Section 21.4.5.3, 'Data Sampling.').\n\nFigure 21-15.

In conjunction with the DMA interface it is possible to transmit entire frames (or sequences of\n\nEnhanced Serial Communication Interface (eSCI)\n\nframes) and receive data from LIN slaves without any CPU intervention. There is no special support for LIN slave mode. If required, LIN slave mode may be implemented in software.\n\nA LIN frame consists of a break character (10 or 13 bits), a sync field, an ID field, n data fields ( n could be 0) and a checksum field. The data and checksum bytes are either provided by the LIN master (TX frame) or by the LIN slave (RX frame). The header fields will always be generated by the LIN master.\n\nBreak\n\nSync\n\nID\n\nData\n\nData\n\nCSum\n\n...\n\nFigure 21-23. Typical LIN frame\n\nThe LIN hardware is highly configurable. This configurability allows the eSCI's LIN hardware to generate frames for LIN slaves from all revisions of the LIN standard. The settings are adjusted according to the capabilities of the slave device.\n\nIn order to activate the LIN hardware, the LIN mode bit in the ESCI x \\_LCR needs to be set. Other settings, such as double stop flags after bit errors and automatic parity bit generation, are also available for use in LIN mode.\n\nThe eSCI settings must be made according to the LIN specification. The eSCI must be configured for 2-wire operation (2 wires connected to the LIN transceiver) with 8 data bytes and no parity. Normally a 13-bit break is used, but the eSCI can also be configured for 10-bit breaks as required by the application."

The ESCI \\_LTR can be configured to include or not include header bits in the checksum on a frame by frame x basis. This feature supports LIN slaves with different LIN revisions. The LIN control register allows the user to decide whether the parity bits in the ID field should be calculated automatically and whether double stop flags should be inserted after a bit error.

The CRC bytes are not part of the LIN standard, but could be part of the application layer, that is they would be treated as data bytes by the LIN protocol.

    ],
    "chunk_type": "text",
    "content": "The following procedure describes how a basic TX frame is generated.\n\nThe frame is controlled via the LIN transmit register (ESCI x \\_LTR). Initially, the application software will need to check the TXRDY bit (either using an interrupt, the TX DMA interface, or by polling the LIN status register). If TXRDY is set, the register is writable. Before each write, TXRDY must be checked (though this step is performed automatically in DMA mode). The first write to the ESCI x \\_LTR must contain the LIN ID field. The next write to ESCI x \\_LTR specifies the length of the frame (0 to 255 Bytes). The third write to ESCI x \\_LTR contains the control byte (frame direction, checksum/CRC settings). Note that timeout bits are not included in TX frames, since they only refer to LIN slaves. The three previously mentioned writes to the ESCI x \\_LTR specify the LIN frame data. Once the LIN frame data is specified, the eSCI LIN hardware starts to generate a LIN frame.\n\nFirst, the eSCI transmits a break field. The sync field is transmitted next. The third field is the ID field. After  these  three  fields  have  been  broadcast,  the  ESCIx\\_LTR  accepts  data  bytes;  the  LIN  hardware transmits these data bytes as soon as they are available and can be sent out. After the last step the LIN hardware automatically appends the checksum field.\n\nIt  is  possible  to  set  up  a  DMA  channel  to  handle  all  the  tasks  required  to  send  a  TX  frame.  (See Figure 21-25 for more information.) For this operation, the TX DMA channel must be activated by setting the ESCI \\_CR2[TXDMA] bit. The control information for the LIN frame (ID, message length, TX/RX x type, timeout, etc.) and the data bytes are stored at an appropriate memory location. The DMA controller is  then  set  up  to  transfer  this  block  of  memory  to  a  location  (the  ESCI x \\_LTR). After transmission is complete, either the DMA controller or the LIN hardware can generate an interrupt to the CPU."

The LIN master verifies CRC and checksum bytes transmitted by the slave.\n\nFor a RX frame, control information must be written to the ESCI x \\_LTR in the same manner as for the TX frames. Additionally the timeout bits, which define the time to complete the entire frame, must be written. Then the ESCI \\_SR[RXRDY] bit must be checked (either with an interrupt, RX DMA interface, or by x polling) to detect incoming data bytes. The checksum byte normally does not appear in the ESCI x \\_LRR, instead the LIN hardware will verify the checksum and issue an interrupt, if the checksum value is not correct.\n\nTwo  DMA  channels  can  be  used  when  executing  a  RX  frame:  one  to  transfer  the  header/control information from a memory location to the ESCI x \\_LTR, and one to transfer the incoming data bytes from the ESCI \\_LRR to a table in memory.

    "content": "The LIN hardware can detect several error conditions of the LIN protocol. LIN hardware will receive every byte that was transmitted, and compare it with the intended values. If there is a mismatch, a bit error is issued, and the LIN FSM will return to its start state.\n\nFor a RX frame the LIN hardware can detect a slave timeout error. The exact slave timeout error value can be set via the timeout bits in the ESCI x \\_LTR. If the frame is not complete within the number of clock cycles specified in the register, the LIN FSM will return to its start state, and the STO interrupt is issued.\n\nThe LIN protocol supports a sleep mode. After 25,000 bus cycles of inactivity the bus is assumed to be in sleep mode. Normally entering sleep mode can be avoided, if the LIN master is regularly creating some bus activity. Otherwise the timeout state needs to be detected by the application software, for example by setting a timer.\n\nBoth LIN masters and LIN slaves can cause the bus to exit sleep mode by sending a break signal. The LIN hardware will generate such a break, when WU bit in the LIN control register is written. After transmitting this break the LIN hardware will not send out data (that is not raise the TXRDY flag) before the wake-up delimiter period has expired. This period can be selected by setting the WUD bits in the LIN control register.\n\nBreak signals sent by a LIN slave are received by the LIN hardware, and so indicated by setting the WAKE flag in the LIN status register.\n\nA physical bus error (LIN bus is permanently stuck at a fixed value) will set several error flags. If the input is permanently low, the eSCI will set the framing error (FE) flag in the eSCI status register. If the RXD input remains stuck at a fixed value for 15 cycles, after a transmission has started, the LIN hardware will set the PBERR flag in the LIN status register. In addition a bit error may be generated."
