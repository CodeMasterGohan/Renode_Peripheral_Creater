    "content": "The MPC5553 and MPC5554 microcontrollers (MCU) are the first members of the MPC5500 family of next generation powertrain microcontrollers based on the PowerPC Book E architecture. The MPC5500 family contains a PowerPC\u2122 processor core. This family of parts contains many new features coupled with  high  performance  CMOS  technology  to  provide  significant  performance  improvement  over  the MPC565.\n\nThe e200z6 CPU of the MPC5500 family is based on the PowerPC Book E architecture. It is 100% user mode compatible  (with  floating  point  library)  with  the  classic  PowerPC  instruction  set.  The  Book  E architecture has enhancements that improve the PowerPC architecture's fit in embedded applications. This core also has additional instructions, including digital signal processing (DSP) instructions, beyond the classic PowerPC instruction set.\n\nThe MPC5553 and MPC5554 of the MPC5500 family have two levels of memory hierarchy. The fastest accesses are to the unified cache (32-kilobytes in the MPC5554, 8-kilobytes in the MPC5553). The next level in the hierarchy contains the 96-kilobyte internal SRAM and internal Flash memory (2 Mbytes Flash in the MPC5554, 1.5 Mbytes in the MPC5553). Both the internal SRAM and the Flash memory can hold instructions  and  data.  The  external  bus  interface  has  been  designed  to  support  most  of  the  standard memories used with the MPC5xx family.\n\nThe complex I/O timer functions of the MPC5500 family are performed by an enhanced time processor unit  engines  (eTPU)  -  two  in  the  MPC5554,  one  in  the  MPC5553.  Each  eTPU  engine  controls  32 hardware channels. The eTPU has been enhanced over the TPU by providing 24-bit timers, double action hardware channels, variable  number  of  parameters  per  channel,  angle  clock  hardware,  and  additional control  and  arithmetic  instructions.  The  eTPU  can  be  programmed  using  a  high-level  programming language.\n\nThe  less  complex  timer  functions  of  the  MPC5500  family  are  performed  by  the  enhanced  modular input/output system (eMIOS). The eMIOS' 24 hardware channels are capable of single action, double action, pulse width modulation (PWM) and modulus counter operation. Motor control capabilities include edge-aligned and center-aligned PWM.\n\nOff-chip communication is performed by a suite of serial protocols including controller area networks (FlexCANs) - three FlexCANs in the MPC5554 and two in the MPC5553, an enhanced deserial/serial peripheral interface  (DSPI) - four in the MPC5554 and three in the MPC5553, and enhanced serial communications interfaces (eSCIs). The DSPIs support pin reduction through hardware serialization and deserialization of timer channels and general-purpose input/output (GPIO) signals.\n\nThe MCU of the MPC5553 and MPC5554 has an on-chip 40-channel enhanced queued dual analog to digital converter (eQADC).\n\nThe system integration unit (SIU) performs several chip-wide configuration functions. Pad configuration and general-purpose input and output (GPIO) are controlled from the SIU. External interrupts and reset control are also found in the SIU. The internal multiplexer submodule (SIU\\_DISR) provides multiplexing of eQADC trigger sources, daisy chaining the DSPIs, and external interrupt signal multiplexing.\n\nThe MPC5553 has a fast Ethernet controller (FEC) with a built-in FIFO and a DMA controller.\n\nFigure 1-1  is  a  block  diagram  of  the  MPC5554  (MPC5500  family  MCU),  and  Figure 1-2  is  a  block diagram of the MPC5553.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLEGEND"

    "chunk_type": "text",
    "content": "The MPC5553 and MPC5554 use the e200z6 core explained in detail in the e200z6 PowerPC TM Core Reference  Manual .  The  e200z6  CPU  utilizes  a  seven  stage  pipeline  for  instruction  execution.  The instruction fetch 1, instruction fetch 2, instruction decode/register file read, execute1, execute2/memory access1,  execute3/memory  access2,  and  register  writeback  stages  operate  in  an  overlapped  fashion, allowing single clock instruction execution for most instructions.\n\nThe integer execution unit consists of a 32-bit arithmetic unit (AU), a logic unit (LU), a 32-bit barrel shifter, a mask-insertion unit (MIU), a condition register manipulation unit (CRU), a count-leading-zeros unit (CLZ), a 32x32 hardware multiplier array, result feed-forward hardware, and support hardware for division.\n\nMost arithmetic and logical operations are executed in a single cycle with the exception of multiply, which is implemented with a pipelined hardware array, and the divide instructions. The CLZ unit operates in a single clock cycle.\n\nThe instruction unit contains a program counter (PC) incrementer and a dedicated branch address adder to minimize delays during change of flow operations. Sequential prefetching is performed to ensure a supply of  instructions  into  the  execution  pipeline.  Branch  target  prefetching  is  performed  to  accelerate  taken branches. Prefetched instructions are placed into an instruction buffer capable of holding 6 sequential instructions and 2 branch target instructions.\n\nBranch target addresses are calculated in parallel with branch instruction decode, resulting in execution time of three clocks. Conditional branches which are not taken execute in a single clock. Branches with successful lookahead and target prefetching have an effective execution time of one clock.\n\nMemory load and store operations are provided for byte, halfword, word (32-bit), and doubleword data with automatic zero or sign extension of byte and halfword load data. These instructions can be pipelined to allow effective single cycle throughput. Load and store multiple word instructions allow low overhead context save and restore operations. The load/store unit contains a dedicated effective address adder to allow effective address generation to be optimized.\n\nThe condition register unit supports the condition register (CR) and condition register operations defined by the PowerPC architecture. The condition register consists of eight 4-bit fields that reflect the results of certain operations, such as move, integer and floating-point compare, arithmetic, and logical instructions, and provide a mechanism for testing and branching.\n\nVectored and auto-vectored interrupts are supported by the CPU. Vectored interrupt support is provided to allow multiple interrupt sources to have unique interrupt handlers invoked with no software overhead.\n\nThe signal processing extension (SPE) APU supports vector instructions (SIMD) operating on 16- and 32-bit fixed-point data types, as well as 32-bit IEEE \u00ae -754 single-precision floating-point formats, and supports  single-precision  floating-point  operations  in  a  pipelined  fashion.  The  64-bit  general-purpose register  file  is  used  for  source  and  destination  operands,  and  there  is  a  unified  storage  model  for single-precision floating-point data types of 32-bits and the normal integer type. Low latency fixed-point and floating-point add, subtract, multiply, divide, compare, and conversion operations are provided, and most operations can be pipelined."

The crossbar supports a 32-bit address bus width and a 64-bit data bus width at all master and slave ports.\n\nThe crossbar allows for concurrent transactions to occur from any master port to any slave port. It is possible for all master ports and slave ports to be in use at the same time as a result of independent master requests. If a slave port is simultaneously requested by more than one master port, arbitration logic will select the higher priority master and grant it ownership of the slave port. All other masters requesting that slave port will be stalled until the higher priority master completes its transactions. By default, requesting masters will be treated with equal priority and will be granted access to a slave port in round-robin fashion, based upon the ID of the last master to be granted access."

The INTC allows interrupt request servicing from 308 (MPC5554)/212(MPC5553) interrupt sources.\n\nFor high priority interrupt requests, the time from the assertion of the interrupt request from the peripheral to when the processor is executing the interrupt service routine (ISR) has been minimized. The INTC provides a unique vector for each interrupt request source for quick determination of which ISR needs to be executed. It also provides an ample number of priorities so that lower priority ISRs do not delay the execution of higher priority ISRs. To allow the appropriate priorities for each source of interrupt request, the priority of each interrupt request is software configurable.\n\nWhen multiple tasks share a resource, coherent accesses to that resource must be supported. The INTC supports the priority ceiling protocol for coherent accesses. By providing a modifiable priority mask, the priority  level  can  be  raised  temporarily  so  that  no  task  can  prempt  another  task  that  shares  the  same resource.\n\nMultiple processors can assert interrupt requests to each other through software settable interrupt requests (by using application software to assert requests). These maskable interrupt requests can be used to split the software into a high priority portion and a low priority portion for servicing the interrupt requests. The high priority portion is initiated by a peripheral interrupt request, but then the ISR asserts a software settable interrupt request to finish the servicing in a lower priority ISR."

Logical addresses are translated by the MMU into physical addresses.\n\nUnder software control of the MMU, the logical addresses allocated to modules may be changed on a minimum of a 4-Kbyte boundary. Peripheral modules may be redundantly mapped. The customer must use the MMU to prevent corruption.\n\nTable 1-2 shows a detailed memory map.\n\nTable 1-2.
