    "content": "The FMPLL operational mode is configured during reset. For the MPC5554, the FMPLL mode defaults to crystal reference mode. The 324 and 416 package sizes of the MPC5553 also default to crystal reference mode.  For the MPC5554 and the 324 and 416 package sizes of the MPC5553, if the user should desire to change from this mode, the RSTCFG and PLLCFG[0:1] package pins must be driven to the appropriate state for the desired mode from the time RSTOUT asserts until it negates. As shown in Table 11-1, if RSTCFG is not asserted during reset, the state of the PLLCFG package pins is ignored, and the FMPLL will operate in the default crystal reference mode. The table also shows that to enter any other mode RSTCFG must be asserted during reset.\n\nNote that because the 208 package size of the MPC5553 has no RSTCFG pin, after reset the 208 resets to the values of PLLCFG before reset.

The user must supply a crystal oscillator that is within the appropriate input frequency range, the crystal manufacture's recommended external support circuitry, and short signal route from the MCU to the crystal.\n\nThe external  support  circuitry  for  the  crystal  oscillator  is  shown  in  Figure 11-7.  Example  component values are shown as well. Note that the actual circuit should be reviewed with the crystal manufacturer. A block diagram illustrating crystal reference mode is shown in Figure 11-4.\n\nFigure 11-7. Crystal Oscillator Network\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn crystal reference mode, the FMPLL can generate a frequency modulated clock or a non-modulated clock (locked on a single frequency). The modulation rate, modulation depth, output clock divide ratio (RFD), and whether the FMPLL is modulating or not can be programmed by writing to the FMPLL registers. Crystal reference is the default clock mode for the MPC5554 and the 324 and 416 packages of the MPC5553. It is not necessary to force PLLCFG[0:1] to enter this mode. In the 208 package size, because it has no RSTCFG pin, the crystal reference mode can only be selected through the PLLCFG pins."

The MFD bits control the value of the divider in the FMPLL feedback loop. The value specified by the MFD bits establish the multiplication factor applied to the reference frequency. The decimal equivalent of the MFD binary number is substituted into the equation from Table 11-10 for F sys to determine the equivalent multiplication factor. When the MFD bits are changed, the FMPLL loses lock. At this point, if modulation is enabled, the calibration sequence is reinitialized. To prevent an immediate reset, the LOLRE bit must be cleared before writing the MFD bits. In dual-controller mode, the MFD bits are ignored and the multiplication factor is equivalent to 2X. In bypass mode the MFD bits have no effect. Note: Programming an MFD value such that the ICO operates outside its specified range will cause unpredictable results and the FMPLL will not lock.

Provides the interrupt request flag. This is a write 1 to clear (w1c) bit; to clear the flag, the user must write a 1 to the bit. Writing 0 has no effect. This flag will not be set, and an interrupt will not be requested, if the loss of lock condition was caused by a system reset, a write to the FMPLL_SYNCR which modifies the MFD bits, or enabling frequency modulation. If the flag is set due to a system failure, writing the MFD bits or enabling FM will not clear the flag. Asserting reset will clear the flag. This flag bit is sticky in the sense that if lock is reacquired, the bit will remain set until either a write 1 or reset is asserted. 0 Interrupt service not requested 1 Interrupt service requested Note: Upon a loss of lock that is not generated by a system reset, a write to the FMPLL_SYNCR that modifies the MFD or PREDIV bits, or an enabling of frequency modulation, the LOLF will be set if LOLIRQ is set. If the FMPLL reacquires lock and at that point either of the three above steps are executed, the LOLF will again be set. To avoid an unintentional interrupt from being generated, LOLIRQ must be cleared prior to changing MFD or PREDIV, or prior to enabling FM after a previous interrupt and relock occurred. |\n| 23     | LOC    | Loss-of-clock status. Indicates whether a loss-of-clock condition is present when operating in crystal reference, external reference, or dual-controller mode, If LOC = 0, the system clocks are operating normally. If LOC = 1, the system clocks have failed due to a reference failure or a FMPLL failure. If the read of the LOC bit and the loss-of-clock condition occur simultaneously, the bit does not reflect the current loss of clock condition. If a loss-of-clock condition occurs which sets this bit and the clocks later return to normal, this bit will be cleared. A loss of clock condition can only be detected if LOCEN = 1. LOC is always 0 in bypass mode. 0 Clocks are operating normally 1 Clocks are not operating normally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| 24     | MODE   | Clock mode.

A sticky indication of FMPLL lock status. LOCKS is set by the lock detect circuitry when the FMPLL acquires lock after one of the following: GLYPH<127> a system reset GLYPH<127> a write to the FMPLL_SYNCR which modifies the MFD bits GLYPH<127> the enabling of frequency modulation Whenever the FMPLL loses lock, LOCKS is cleared. LOCKS remains cleared even after the FMPLL relocks, until one of the three previously-stated conditions occurs. Furthermore, if the LOCKS bit is read when the FMPLL simultaneously loses lock, the bit does not reflect the current loss of lock condition. If operating in bypass mode, LOCKS remains cleared after reset. In crystal reference, external reference, and dual-controller mode, LOCKS is set after reset. 0 PLL has lost lock since last system reset, a write to FMPLL_SYNCR to modify the MFD bit field, or frequency modulation enabled. 1 PLL has not lost lock since last system reset, a write to FMPLL_SYNCR to modify the MFD bit field, or frequency modulation enabled. |\n|     28 | LOCK    | PLL lock status bit. Indicates whether the FMPLL has acquired lock. FMPLL lock occurs when the synthesized frequency matches to within approximately 0.75% of the programmed frequency. The FMPLL loses lock when a frequency deviation of greater than approximately 1.5% occurs. If the LOCK bit is read when the FMPLL simultaneously loses lock or acquires lock, the bit does not reflect the current condition of the FMPLL. If operating in bypass mode, LOCK remains cleared after reset. 0 PLL is unlocked. 1 PLL is locked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|     29 | LOCF    | Loss-of-clock flag. This bit provides the interrupt request flag. This is a write 1 to clear (w1c) bit; to clear the flag, the user must write a 1 to the bit. Writing 0 has no effect. Asserting reset will clear the flag. This flag is sticky in the sense that if clocks return to normal after the flag has been set, the bit will remain set until cleared by either writing 1 or asserting reset. 0 Interrupt service not requested 1 Interrupt service requested                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|     30 | CALDONE | Calibration complete. Indicates whether the calibration sequence has been completed since the last time modulation was enabled. If CALDONE = 0 then the calibration sequence is either in progress or modulation is disabled. If CALDONE = 1 then the calibration sequence has been completed, and frequency modulation is operating. 0 Calibration not complete. 1 Calibration complete.

Indicates whether the calibration routine was successful. If CALPASS = 1 and CALDONE = 1 then the routine was successful. If CALPASS = 0 and CALDONE = 1, then the routine was unsuccessful. When the calibration routine is initiated the CALPASS is asserted. CALPASS remains asserted until either modulation is disabled by clearing the DEPTH bits in the FMPLL_SYNCR or a failure occurs within the FMPLL calibration sequence. 0 Calibration unsuccessful. 1 Calibration successful.

The clock dividers divide the system clock down by even integer values. The three clock output pins are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 CLKOUT - External address/data bus clock\n- \u00b7 MCKO - Nexus auxiliary port clock\n- \u00b7 ENGCLK - Engineering clock\n\nThe MPC5553/MPC5554 MCU has been designed so that the oscillator clock can be selected as the clock source for the CAN interface in the FlexCAN blocks resulting in very low jitter performance.\n\nFigure 11-1 shows a block diagram of the FMPLL and the system clock architecture."

    "content": "Entering the FM calibration mode requires the user to program SYNCR[EXP]. The EXP is the expected value of the difference between the reference and feedback counters used in the calibration of the FM equation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFor example, if 80 MHz is the desired final frequency and 8 MHz crystal is used, the final values of MFD=6 and RFD=0 will produce the desired 80 MHz.  For a desired frequency modulation with a 1% depth, then EXP is calulated using P = 1, MFD = 6 and M = 480. Refer to Table 11-11 for a complete list of values to be used for the variable (M) based on MFD setting. To obtain a percent modulation (P) of 1%, the EXP field would have to be set at: EXP = 6 + 4 ( ) \u22c5 640 1 \u22c5 ( ) / 100 48 =\n\nRounding this value to the closest integer yields the value of 48 that should be entered into the EXP field for this example.\n\nTable 11-11. Multiplied Factor Dividers with M Values\n\n| MFD   |   M |\n|-------|-----|\n| 0-2   | 960 |\n| 3-5   | 640 |\n| 6-8   | 480 |\n| 9-14  | 320 |\n| 15-20 | 240 |\n| 21-31 | 160 |\n\nThis routine will correct for process variations, but as temperature can change after the calibration has been performed, variation due to temperature drift is not eliminated. This frequency modulation calibration system is also voltage dependent, so if supply changes after the sequence takes place, error incurred will not be corrected. The calibration system reuses the two counters in the lock detect circuit, the reference and feedback counters. The reference counter is still clocked by the reference clock, but the feedback counter is clocked by the ICO clock.\n\nWhen  the  calibration  routine  is  initiated  by  writing  to  the  DEPTH  bits,  the  CALPASS  status  bit  is immediately set and the CALDONE status bit is immediately cleared.\n\nWhen calibration is induced, the ICO is given time to settle. Then both the feedback and reference counters start counting. Full ICO clock cycles are counted by the feedback counter during this time to give the initial center frequency count. When the reference counter has counted to the programmed number of reference count cycles, the input to the feedback counter is disabled and the result is placed in the COUNT0 register. The calibration system then enables modulation at programmed \u2206 Fm. The ICO is given time to settle. Both counters are reset and restarted. The feedback counter begins to count full ICO clock cycles again to obtain the delta-frequency count. When the reference counter has counted to the new programmed number of reference count cycles, the feedback counter is stopped again.\n\nThe  delta-frequency  count  minus  the  center  frequency  count  (COUNT0)  results  in  a  delta  count proportional to the reference current into the modulation D/A. That delta count is subtracted from the expected value given in the EXP field of the FMPLL\\_SYNCR  resulting in an error count. The sign of this error count determines the direction taken by the calibration D/A to update the calibration current. After obtaining the error count for the present iteration, both counters are cleared. The stored count of COUNT0\n\nis  preserved  while  a  new  feedback  count  is  obtained,  and  the  process  to  determine  the  error  count  is repeated. The calibration system repeats this process eight times, once for each bit of the calibration D/A.\n\nAfter the last decision is made, the CALDONE bit of the SYNSR is written to a 1. If an error occurs during the calibration routine, then CALPASS is immediately written to a 0. If the routine completed successfully then CALPASS remains a 1.\n\nFigure 11-11 shows a block diagram of the calibration circuitry and its associated registers. Figure 11-12 shows a flow chart showing the steps taken by the calibration circuit.\n\nFigure 11-11. FM Auto-Calibration Data Flow\n\n<!-- image -->"

    "content": "Updated Section 11.4.3.3, 'FM Calibration Routine.' Section 11.4.3.3, just before table 11-11, gives the formula for EXP as EXP = ((4+4).640.1)/100, should be EXP = ((6+4).480.1)/100 = 48. Changed following line of text to \"...yeilds the value of 48...\"\n\nAdded note to Section 11.3.1.1, 'Synthesizer Control Register (FMPLL\\_SYNCR),' that says 'To ensure proper operation across all MPC5500 MCUs, execute an mbar  or msync  instruction between the write to change the FMPLL\\_SYNCR[MFD] and the read to check the lock status shown by FMPLL\\_SYNSR[LOCK]. Furthermore, buffering writes to the FMPLL, as controlled by PBRIDGE\\_A\\_OPACR[BW0], must be disabled' Added cross ref to this section from procedures outlined in Section 11.4.3.1, 'Programming System Clock Frequency Without Frequency Modulation' and Section 11.4.3.2, 'Programming System Clock Frequency with Frequency Modulation.'\n\nAdded 'Caution: Programming a PREDIV value such that the ICO operates outside its specified range will cause unpredictable results and the FMPLL will not lock. Refer to the MPC5553/MPC5554 Data Sheet for details on the ICO range.' to Table 11-10 (Clock-out vs. Clock-in Relationships).\n\nFrequency Modulated Phase Locked Loop (FMPLL) and System Clocks"
