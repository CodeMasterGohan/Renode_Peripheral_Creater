    "content": "The XBAR allows for concurrent transactions to occur from any master port to any slave port. It is possible for all master ports and slave ports to be in use at the same time as a result of independent master requests. If a slave port is simultaneously requested by more than one master port, arbitration logic will select the higher priority master and grant it ownership of the slave port. All other masters requesting that slave port will be stalled until the higher priority master completes its transactions.\n\nBy default, requesting masters will be granted access based on a fixed priority. A round-robin priority mode also is available. In this mode, requesting masters will be treated with equal priority and will be granted access to a slave port in round-robin fashion, based upon the ID of the last master to be granted access. A block diagram of the XBAR is shown in Figure 7-1.\n\nThe XBAR can place each slave port in a low-power park mode so that particular slave port will not dissipate any power transitioning address, control or data signals when not being actively accessed by a master port. There is a one-cycle arbitration overhead for exiting low power park mode.\n\nEach slave port can independently support multiple master priority schemes. Each slave port has a hardware input that selects the master priority scheme so the user can dynamically change master priority levels on a slave-port-by-slave-port basis."

    "content": "The XBAR\\_SGPCR  of a slave port controls several features of the slave port, including the following: n\n\n- \u00b7 Round-robin or fixed arbitration policy for a particular slave port\n- \u00b7 Write protection of any slave port registers\n- \u00b7 Parking algorithm used for a slave port\n\nThe PARK field indicates which master port this slave port will park on when no active access attempts are being made to the slave and the parking control field is set to park on a specific master.\n\nXBAR\\_SGPCR [PARK] should only be programmed to select master ports that are actually available on n the device, otherwise undefined behavior will result. The low-power park feature can result in an overall power savings if the slave port is not saturated; however, an extra clock of latency will result whenever any master tries to access a slave (not being accessed by another master) because it will not be parked on any master.\n\nThe XBAR\\_SGPCR can only be accessed in supervisor mode with 32-bit accesses. Once the RO (read only) bit has been set in the XBAR\\_SGPCR, the XBAR\\_SGPCR and the SBAR\\_MPR can only be read. Attempts to write to them will have no effect and will result in an error response.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Some of these unused bits are writeable and readable, but  the bits serve no function.

    "content": "When a master makes an access to the XBAR from an idle master state, the access will be  taken immediately by the XBAR. If the targeted slave port of the access is available (that is, the requesting master is currently granted ownership of the slave port), the access will be immediately presented on the slave port. It is possible to make single clock (zero wait state) accesses through the XBAR by a granted master. If the targeted slave port of the access is busy or parked on a different master port, the requesting master will simply see wait states inserted until the targeted slave port can service the master's request. The latency in servicing the request will depend on each master's priority level and the responding slave's access time.\n\nBecause the XBAR appears to be just another slave to the master device, the master device will have no knowledge of whether or not it actually owns the slave port it is targeting. While the master does not have control of the slave port it is targeting it will simply be wait-stated.\n\nA master will be given control of a targeted slave port only after a previous access to a different slave port has completed, regardless of its priority on the newly targeted slave port. This prevents deadlock from occurring when a master has an outstanding request to slave port A that has a long response time, has a pending access to a different slave port B, and a lower priority master also makes a request to the different slave port B. In this case, the lower priority master will be granted bus ownership of slave port B after a cycle of arbitration, assuming the higher priority master's slave port A access is not terminated.\n\nOnce a master has control of the slave port it is targeting, the master will remain in control of that slave port until it either gives up the slave port by running an IDLE cycle, leaves that slave port for its next access, or loses control of the slave port to a higher priority master with a request to the same slave port. However, since all masters run a fixed-length burst transfer to a slave port, it will retain control of the slave port until that transfer sequence is completed. In round-robin arbitration mode, the current master will be forced to hand off bus ownership to an alternately requesting master at the end of its current transfer sequence.\n\nWhen a slave bus is being idled by the XBAR, it can be parked on the master port indicated by the PARK bits in the XBAR\\_SGPCR (slave general-purpose control register), or on the last master to have control of the slave port. This can be done in an attempt to save the initial clock of arbitration delay that would otherwise be seen if the master had to arbitrate to gain control of the slave port. The slave port can also be put into low power park mode in attempt to save power."

In this case the XBAR will be completely transparent and the master's access will be immediately seen on the slave bus and no arbitration delays will be incurred. A master access will be stalled if the access decodes to a slave port that is busy serving another master, parked on another master or is in low-power park mode.\n\nIf the slave port is currently parked on another master or is in low power park mode, and no other master is requesting access to the slave port, then only one clock of arbitration will be incurred. If the slave port\n\nis currently serving another master of a lower priority and the master has a higher priority than all other requesting masters, then the master will gain control over the slave port as soon as the data phase of the current access is completed. If the slave port is currently servicing another master of a higher priority, then the master will gain control of the slave port once the other master releases control of the slave port if no other higher priority master is also waiting for the slave port.\n\nA master access will be responded to with an error if the access decodes to a location not occupied by a slave port. This is the only time the XBAR will directly respond with an error response. All other error responses received by the master are the result of error responses on the slave ports being passed through the XBAR."

    "content": "When operating in round-robin mode, each master is assigned a relative priority based on the master number. This relative priority is compared to the ID of the last master to perform a transfer on the slave bus. The highest priority requesting master will become owner of the slave bus at the next transfer boundary (accounting for fixed-length burst transfers). Priority is based on how far ahead the ID of the requesting master is to the ID of the last master. ID is defined by the master port number.\n\nOnce granted access to a slave port, a master may perform as many transfers as desired to that port until another master makes a request to the same slave port. The next master in line will be granted access to the slave port when the current transfer is completed, or possibly on the next clock cycle if the current master has no pending access request.\n\nAs an example of arbitration in round-robin mode, assume the three masters have ID's 0, 1, and 2. If the last master of the slave port was master 1, and masters 0 and 2 make simultaneous requests, they will be serviced in the order 2 and then 0 assuming no further requests are made.\n\nAs another example, if master 1 is waiting on a response from a slow slave and has no further pending access to that slave, no other masters are requesting, and master 0 then makes a request, master 0's request will be granted on the next clock (assuming that master 1's transfer is not a burst transfer), and the request information for master 0 will be driven to the slave as a pending access. If master 2 were to make a request after master 0 has been granted access, but prior to master 0's access being accepted by the slave, master 0 will continue to be granted the slave port, and master 2 will be delayed until the next arbitration boundary, which occurs once the transfer is complete. The round-robin pointer will have been reset to 0, so master 1 could actually be granted the bus next if it has another request which occurs prior to the completion of master 0's transfer. This implies a worst case latency of N transfers for a system with N masters.\n\nParking may still be used in round-robin mode, but will not affect the round-robin pointer unless the parked master actually performs a transfer. Handoff will occur to the next master in line after one cycle of arbitration.\n\nThe slave port does an arbitration check at every clock edge to ensure that the proper master (if any) has control of the slave port.\n\nA new requesting master must wait until the end of the fixed-length burst transfer, before it will be granted control of the slave port. But if the new requesting master's priority level is lower than that of the master that currently has control of the slave port, the new requesting master will be forced to wait until the master that currently has control of the slave port is finished accessing the current slave port."

The behavior here is the same as for the POL mode with the exception that a specific master will be parked on instead of the last master to access the slave port. If the master designated by the PARK field tries to access the slave port it will not pay an arbitration penalty, while any other master will pay a one clock penalty.\n- \u00b7 If the park on last (POL) mode is selected, then the slave port will park on the last master to access it, passing that master's signals through to the slave bus. When that master accesses the slave port again it will not pay any arbitration penalty; however, if any other master wishes to access the slave port a one clock arbitration penalty will be imposed.\n- \u00b7 If the low power park (LPP) mode is selected, then the slave port will enter low power park mode. It will not recognize any master as being in control of it and it will not select any master's signals to pass through to the slave bus.
