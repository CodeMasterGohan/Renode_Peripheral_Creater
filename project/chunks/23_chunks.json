To  avoid  this  power sequencing requirement, the user should power up V RC33  within the specified operating range, even if not using the on chip voltage regulator controller. Refer to Section 23.5.3.1, 'Power-Up Sequence If V RC33 Grounded' and Section 23.5.3.2, 'Power-Down Sequence If V RC33  Grounded.'\n\nAnother power sequencing requirement is that V DD33  must be of sufficient voltage before POR negates so that the values on certain pins are treated as 1s when POR does negate. Refer to Section 23.5.3.3, 'Input Value of Pins During POR Dependent on V DD33 .'\n\nAlthough there is no power sequencing required between V RC33  and V DDSYN , during power up, in order for the VRC staged turn-on to operate within specification, V RC33  must not lead V DDSYN  by more than 600 mV or lag by more than 100 mV. Higher spikes in the emitter current of the pass transistor will occur if V RC33  leads or lags V DDSYN  by more than those amounts. The value of that higher spike in current depends on the board power supply circuitry and the amount of board level capacitance.\n\nWhen powering down, V RC33  and V DDSYN  do not have a delta requirement to each other because the bypass capacitors internal and external to the SoC already are charged.\n\nWhen not powering up or down, V RC33  and V DDSYN  do not have a delta requirement to each other for the VRC to operate within specification."
